                <description>Cleared old RSS entries since the links are probably mostly broken now (sorry archivists). 
                I got behind on some stuff and have been moving things around. 
                Reading/playing/tunes page has all been updated with a minimalist uniform look (css animations :O). 
                - I've added my thoughts on a Mal Blum album.. 
                - I also updated my diary at some point earlier this april (i know it says 4/22 which is obviously incorrect) 
                - Hopefully more updates this month.. Exploring nekoweb has me on a bit of a kick.
