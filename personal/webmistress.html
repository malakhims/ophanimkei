                    salutations. i am mala. i'm a boring girl. there is nothing interesting about me. i make games about girls who also find themselves uninteresting.
                    <br><br>
                    i'm in between majors right now and completely ruined as a result. i also got kicked out of my housing a few days ago. i've been wearing my hair in curls lately. life is bizarre and strange, but i am trying my best. i try to make games to deal with this bizarre world, but i don't make money for it and everyone around me tells me i'll have to stop someday.
                    <br><br>
                    apologies if you try to talk to me and i don't respond. it's not out of lack of desire. i'm just very depressed you see, but have to suppress this when talking to others. i am also working on personal projects, and focusing on them is very important.
