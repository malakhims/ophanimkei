            <h1>100 Lolita Questions</h1>

            <p><strong>1. Please tell us your screen name, date of birth, and origin.</strong><br>
              I'm Malaika though I go by Mala. I was born July 25th, and I'm from the United States.</p>
              
              <p><strong>2. What is your height, weight, clothing size, and shoe size?</strong><br>
              I'm 5'4. Guess the rest!</p>
              
              <p><strong>3. What made you start doing Lolita fashion?</strong><br>
              I've been interested in the fashion for several years and finally got enough money and space from my family to order a dress! The final push was my friend Io teaching me how to use Taobao.</p>
              
              <p><strong>4. What is your favorite Lolita genre?</strong><br>
              I'm a big goth and classic. Glassic? I also love old school in various substyles but especially punk and casual.</p>
              
              <p><strong>5. Do you have any particular commitment to that genre, or your own definition of it?</strong><br>
              I usually look for pieces that can go with nu old school or old school itself though some pieces I buy are inspired by old school but a bit too modern to even be considered nu. I guess it is my own spin on it, but really, I just buy what I like and my tastes tend to be consistent.</p>
              
              <p><strong>6. Do you have your ears pierced? How many piercings?</strong><br>
              Yes, but I'm not sure they count. My ears are pierced. Just one piercing on both sides. I've had them pierced since I was a baby</p>
              
              <p><strong>7. What is your favorite brand?</strong><br>
              I honestly don't know... Perhaps H Naoto or N+ah but I don't own many pieces from them (yet)</p>
              
              <p><strong>8. What is your favorite outfit?</strong><br>
              I love going blouseless in BTSSB's babydoll jsk. A cardigan addition is also cute. Sock can very. It's a comfy outfit I feel consistently cute it.</p>
              
              <p><strong>9. Lolita How many friends do you have?</strong><br>
              So many! So many! I can't count them!</p>
              
              <p><strong>10. What was the best thing about doing Lolita?</strong><br>
              I love the connections I've made in the community- online and offline. It's gotten me out of the house, and I've spoken to people I never imagined speaking to! I also love speaking to Chinese lolitas.</p>
              
              <p><strong>11. On the contrary, what is the most disgusting thing?</strong><br>
              I dislike the lack of research common among people in the subculture. It makes me uncomfortable.</p>
              
              <p><strong>12. What is your favorite magazine?</strong><br>
              I like Fruits and Kera, but I don't actively collect them.</p>
              
              <p><strong>13. Headdress group? Team Bonnet? Team Headbow?</strong><br>
              I like old school rectangular headpieces though lately I've been getting into berets. I also love headbows but unfortunately they can give me headaches.</p>
              
              <p><strong>14. Do you have bloomers?</strong><br>
              Yes, I love bloomers. They help me feel safe.</p>
              
              <p><strong>15. Do you tie your headdress in front? or are you on the team that ties it behind your head?</strong><br>
              I tied them in the back typically. I find the sensory experience of tying them in the front to be a bit unbearable.</p>
              
              <p><strong>16. Do you have a favorite music genre or band?</strong><br>
              My favorite band is Panchiko, and lately I've been listening to a variety of gothic genres.</p>
              
              <p><strong>17. What is your mobile phone ringtone?</strong><br>
              It's just the default apple ringtone. I mainly call my girlfriend and family. I thought about changing it to a song, but I got embarrassed thinking about it playing in innapropriate settings.</p>
              
              <p><strong>18. Do you go to lives in Lolita?</strong><br>
              I saw Machine Girl in lolita!</p>
              
              <p><strong>19. For those who go to lives, do you headbang?</strong><br>
              I mosh until I get grossed out by the sweat then I bounce up and down. Maybe I'd headbang in the right setting.</p>
              
              <p><strong>20. What color do you like?</strong><br>
              Black, pink, red, white</p>
              
              <p><strong>21. What are your hobbies?</strong><br>
              Art, coding, writing, game deving, gaming, etc</p>
              
              <p><strong>22. Please tell me if you have a favorite perfume.</strong><br>
              I like perfume that smells like desserts.</p>
              
              <p><strong>23. Is there anything you say "I'm careful about this" when it comes to lolita?</strong><br>
              I'm careful with laundry, and I try not to get lace stuck on things.</p>
              
              <p><strong>24. Where are the places you visit / hang out at frequently?</strong><br>
              I visit the cemetery often. It is a go to spot. I realize it is inherently strange and can easily get me judged, but I really just find it to  be a nice place. There's usually not a lot of people (and if there is a group of people, you can just go to the other side to not disturb them). I also like to talk to the graves and connect various family members. I'm fascinated by last names that reveals a family's ethnic background. I think people when they're buried can get lonely. If ghosts are real, that means they're connected to their physical bodies or place of death! </p>
              
              <p><strong>25. How many times a week do you wear Lolita?</strong><br>
              I wear lolita whenever I don't have to go to work!</p>
              
              <p><strong>26. Please tell us the most embarrassing episode you had when you were a beginner in Lolita fashion.</strong><br>
              To be honest every time I start to crash out in lolita I feel embarrassed.</p>
              
              <p><strong>27. What is your hairstyle and color now?</strong><br>
              I've been doing twist outs for the last few days. It's black.</p>
              
              <p><strong>28. How long have you been in Lolita?</strong><br>
              My first dress was worn April in 2023, but I've been interested for much longer. I can't believe I've been a reel lolita for two years.</p>
              
              <p><strong>29. Do you have a dedicated lolita storage space?</strong><br>
              Yes, I have a large metal rack, but it's running out of space. When I go home briefly for summer, I don't have anywhere to put my clothes.</p>
              
              <p><strong>30. Have you ever thought about leaving Lolita? If so, why?</strong><br>
              I've thought about what I'll do in the future if I lose interest or feel old, but I think my style would just shift.. or I'd get into another frilly jfashion that is a bit less hard on my body.</p>
              
              <p><strong>31. What is your motto?</strong><br>
                "There's no point worrying about things you can't fix." Technically it's not my motto. I just got it from Kodocha.

              <p><strong>32. What are your dreams for the future?</strong><br>
              I hope I have a job that allows me to be happy and do what I like.</p>
              
              <p><strong>33. "This person would definitely look good on Lolita!" Are there any celebrities you think that about?</strong><br>
              No. I don't know any celebrities and honestly whenever a celebrity wears lolita fashion, I usually wish they didn't.</p>
              
              <p><strong>34. Please tell us the item with the most memories and those memories.</strong><br>
              Nameless Poem! I went to my first meetup in it. It's also the first lolita piece I ever desired, and the first dress I owned. I don't wear it often as I feel it's a very dramatic piece that draws a lot of attention to me, but I do love her.</p>
              
              <p><strong>35. What was the first item you got?</strong><br>
              Nameless Poem was my first main item as I said before!</p>
              
              <p><strong>36. Do you have a signature pose for taking a picture?</strong><br>
              I tend to bend my knees slightly, stand with my legs slightly apart, and look away from the camera. Not always but it's my go to when I feel like none of my other pics have turned out good.</p>
              
              <p><strong>37. What is the "Bible" of your heart? (Like what Books, magazines, CDs, etc. represent your inner self)</strong><br>
              My Tumblr is the bible of my heart.</p>
              
              <p><strong>38. How many centimeters tall is the highest heel you have?</strong><br>
              It's probably a tie between my antaina RHS and my platform Crocs.</p>
              
              <p><strong>39. Have you ever worn a tiara?</strong><br>
              Not with lolita, but I'd really like to. I've worn big bulky crowns though.</p>
              
              <p><strong>40. Do you want to be a prince once in a while? What kind of prince? Dark system? Hakubakei?</strong><br>
              Kind of but being a doll-like princess is what satisfies me most.</p>
              
              <p><strong>41. What kind of lace do you like?</strong><br>
              I have the potential to like all lace really. It just depends on how its used and placed.</p>
              
              <p><strong>42. Do you own a (ball jointed) doll? Those who have them are usually so enthusiastic about them!</strong><br>
              No, but there's cheaper one I've been hunting for that's out of stock everywhere.</p>
              
              <p><strong>43. What's inside your lolita bag right now?</strong><br>
              Pens.. Wallet.. iPad.</p>
              
              <p><strong>44. What is your favorite flower?</strong><br>
              Roses though truthfully this is just because it is my granny's favorite flower.</p>
              
              <p><strong>45. What is your favorite accessory right now?</strong><br>
              My Jane Marple ring</p>
              
              <p><strong>46. Please tell us your favorite / recommended cosmetics.</strong><br>
              I don't wear makeup.</p>
              
              <p><strong>47. Bright eyes are the hallmark of being a doll! So do you use false eyelashes? If you have any tips on how to use them, please let me know.</strong><br>
              I don't.. I wear glasses! So it feels silly to do lots of eye makeup.</p>
              
              <p><strong>48. What is your particular eye makeup style?</strong><br>
              I like heavy eyeliner but I don't wear it myself.</p>
              
              <p><strong>49. Is your lipstick red? Blue? black? pink?</strong><br>
              My lipstick is dark brown, but I hardly wear it.</p>
              
              <p><strong>50. What color do you often use for nail polish?</strong><br>
              Black, but I also hardly do my nails.</p>
              
              <p><strong>51. Have you ever changed your clothes in the toilet at the train station?</strong><br>
              Not at the train station because I am American and there are hardly any trains where I live, but at a courthouse.</p>
              
              <p><strong>52. Have you ever had twin loli or triplet loli? impression?</strong><br>
              Yes! I twinned with my dear friend Robin though they were in ouji. I also plan to twin with my girlfriend, but the dress I bought to twin with her is lost in the mail.</p>
              
              <p><strong>53. What are you doing to keep in shape? Recommendations?</strong><br>
              I walk around college campus mostly, but when I am more health conscious, I also do yoga and lift weights.</p>
              
              <p><strong>54. Are you calm when alone in lolita? (ヒトリでロリータ、平気？)</strong><br>
              I'm generally calm in lolita. I feel less calm in normal clothes and avoid being seen.</p>
              
              <p><strong>55. How much do you spend on lolita each month?</strong><br>
              Sometimes zero. Sometimes much more.</p>
              
              <p><strong>56. Did you have any time lag between learning about Lolita fashion and actually doing it or resistance to starting?</strong><br>
              My time lag was 8+ years I think.</p>
              
              <p><strong>57. What is the most expensive thing you have ever bought? (In relation to Lolita)</strong><br>
              N+ah Rust Puff Sleeve OP set. Sometimes I feel horrible knowing I spent that much, but I've been feral about the dress for a long time, and when it dropped again, I couldn't stop thinking about it.</p>
              
              <p><strong>58. Lolita really costs money, doesn't it? How do you pay for Lolita?</strong><br>
              I work, do commissions, cry, sell old clothes, do payment plans. I used to have a lot more money to spend, but a lot of my paycheck goes to medical expenses.</p>
              
              <p><strong>59. Just here. How much is the total cost you have spent so far?</strong><br>
              It's a secret! Though I'm sure someone could calculate it.</p>
              
              <p><strong>60. Is there a store you would like to see nearby?</strong><br>
              Honestly, I just want to move to Japan or China for a little while. I don't think lolita stores can exist here, and if they do, the markup would make it not worth it.</p>
              
              <p><strong>61. Just between us, is there a store that makes you say: 'that's a rip-off!'?</strong><br>
              Basic answer but Moi Meme Moitie. I really do try to see the brightside of their modern designs, butI always end up thinking the fabric and cuts are weird. The photos on their social media are actually getting better lately, yet the clothes themselves still look terrible.
            <br>
              And well, I also think Closetchild over prices things. I don't really like that store much anymore unless I'm buying something really casual.
            </p>
              
              <p><strong>62. Have you ever used an online shop? If you have, please give us some advice on the good points and bad points. If you haven't, tell us why not.</strong><br>
              Yes though I've shopped in person at Nightshade and in Japan too. I think Chinese resellers are often too overpriced- even the ones I think fondly of, but I simply think DevilInspired is the worst of them all. Their are so many beautiful Chinese dresses, yet Devilinspired will stock something that has horrible reviews or is made of terrible polyester.
              <br>
              Also,you need to know your measurements. You can't just guess because each brand operates differently and the sizing can vary each release. Even being a few cm off can ruin an item for you.</p>
              
              <p><strong>63. Just between us, even if you want to keep it your own secret, what's an indie brand that makes you go "this is exactly my style".</strong><br>
              N+ah.</p>
              
              <p><strong>64. Absolutely out of reach! But I want it! Do you have any brands or products like that for you?</strong><br>
              Mm.. H Naoto..</p>
              
              <p><strong>65. What do you do with your tired old clothes?</strong><br>
              I sell them or give them away.</p>
              
              <p><strong>66. What was the most recent lolita and non lolita item of clothing you bought?</strong><br>
              The last item I bought was the 'FRILL Crown and Roses Ruffle Cutsew.' I honestly.. don't remember thre last non lolita item of clothing I bought, but I've been int the market for some comfy but cool pants for work. Most of my old pants don't fit anymore.</p>
              
              <p><strong>67. What is something you missed out on that you'll never see again, but you can't forget?</strong><br>
              There is this beautiful blouse with an elastic waist and cross on the chest by the indie brand Elegy. Absolute perfection.</p>
              
              <p><strong>68. What do you think of dressing as a Lolita only during live performances?</strong><br>
              It is peak to me though you must choose an item suited for it. Make sure you don't overheat and it is something that can be washed or aired out.</p>
              
              <p><strong>69. What do you think of No-Makeup-Lolita?</strong><br>
              I don't really wear makeup! It's fine to me. Most of my favorite pictures of people in lolita don't have makeup or have very little.</p>
              
              <p><strong>70. You suddenly meet another person totally wearing Lolita! What do you do?</strong><br>
              I've met other people in the wild wearing lolita, and I usually ask them what brand they're wearing. Sometimes I exchange Instagrams.</p>
              
              <p><strong>71. How old is a Lolita allowed to be?</strong><br>
              Age is irrelevant really.</p>
              
              <p><strong>72. Under what conditions do you think Lolita should graduate? (You can answer 'continue forever')</strong><br>
              Lolitas can continue forever!</p>
              
              <p><strong>73. Stop this! Are there any things no one should do in Lolita fashion?</strong><br>
              Mmmm... mmmm.. I don't know. Don't be a creep or a weirdo. If you're in public, be chill and don't act like a child or a little anime girl.</p>
              
              <p><strong>74. Do you have a specific sense of what a perfect Lolita should be?</strong><br>
              Misako is probably the perfect lolita, but well, I don't think anyone should strive for perfection unless they really want to. I certainly don't most of the time.</p>
              
              <p><strong>75. Other than what you said 73, what is something you wish people wouldn't do?</strong><br>
              I wish people recognized there are a lot of beautiful Chinese brand items despite the questionable ones we're often exposed to... People make broad generalizations about them because of DI garbage and well, even some stuff 42lolita sells isn't fantastic, but well, I feel like with all things in this fashion, if you spend time to really look through the market, you'll see interesting Chinese brands are.
              <br>
              Also I dislike when people use ita too much. Just say you don't like something. People can be so boring and expect everyone else to be boring like them. There's things that certainly are ita but a coord with a few elements you personally dislike isn't ita.</p>
              
              <p><strong>76. What do you think about Lolita fashion for men?</strong><br>
              I don't care. Many of my friends are male lolitas and dress better than me, and Mana Sama is a guy. Just don't be weird.</p>
              
              <p><strong>77. Have you changed in any way since you started Lolita?</strong><br>
              I wear a lot more color, and the dresses I buy have various lengths.</p>
              
              <p><strong>78. What do the people around you say about you wearing Lolita? Do you accept it?</strong><br>
              "You look great" or "What are you cosplaying?" or "You look like Alice In Wonderland." My family can be kind of weird about it but they don't disparage me to my face which is what matters. At least, my mom stopped disparaging me when we hung out in public and people complimented me.</p>
              
              <p><strong>79. What kind of lolita fashion do you do in the hot summer months?</strong><br>
              I wear camisols, blouseless jsks, cotton ops, cutsews and skirts.. Stuff like that. I'll go OTT sometimes  but I have to be careful because I'll actually pass out.</p>
              
              <p><strong>80. Do you go to school or work in Lolita?</strong><br>
             I I go to college in lolita! I used to go to work in lolita, but my current job has a dress code which is why I'm hunting for comfy pants. Perhaps some cargo pants I'll diy.</p>
              
              <p><strong>81. What is your usual outfit style?</strong><br>
              Ehh.. Gothic.. Old School gothic.. Casual.. Punk.. Primarily those but I'll wear other things too.</p>
              
              <p><strong>82. Do you have any objections to second-hand goods?</strong><br>
              I buy most things secondhand so no, but I do think American lolitas should buy directly from brand more often.</p>
              
              <p><strong>83. Do you have a boyfriend (or husband)? Does he understand?</strong><br>
              The last time I updated this questionairre was 4.24.24 and I remarked on it being a year since I updated and not having a girlfriend. It was a bit silly because I never planned to date in college, but well, I have had a girl for 154 days as of writing this. Isn't life beautiful? She wears a variety of styles (often gothic/emo inspired) so she definitely gets it. She's worn lolita with me, and we intend to twin someday. I'm very happy with her.</p>
              
              <p><strong>84. Please tell us your ideal male image.</strong><br>
              Obviously I am a lesbian, so well, I like when someone is not a male.</p>
              
              <p><strong>85. What kind of person is the Lolita who left the biggest impression on you?</strong><br>
              The lolita who has left the biggest impression on me.. At the moment it's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manonlolistar">Manon</a>. I like the pictures she takes with her girlfriend, and she's always very nice to me. She also makes me think of kewpies.</p>
              
              <p><strong>86. Have you ever made your own clothes? What kind of clothes is it?</strong><br>
              I would like to someday, but I have not.</p>
              
              <p><strong>87. Have you ever made an accessory yourself? What did you make?</strong><br>
              I did when I was younger. I made bows and chokers and stuff, but I don't have any of it anymore.</p>
              
              <p><strong>88. This thing I made was a great success! Is there anything you feel that way about?</strong><br>
              Outside of lolita, I feel this way about illustration and game dev.. Specifically my game Meat Girl.</p>
              
              <p><strong>89. Tell us if you have an ideal Lolita outfit or coordination.</strong><br>
              I love H Naoto gothic coords, N+ah, and a good Chinese gothic coord too with lots of details.</p>
              
              <p><strong>90. Is there anyone you admire? What kind of person are they?</strong><br>
              Ahh, I used to admire lots of people, but it's gets harded to think of them. I mentioned Manon. I guess I also admire Wirehead's creator, and I really admire artists like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/snow_priestess/">snow_priestess</a> who work with indie brands and do art for other events. There's other artists too but I thought of her first.</p>
              
              <p><strong>91. You can date any person for just one day. The other person will also dress however you want. Who is it and what kind of date?</strong><br>
              I am living this dream with my wife, but well, I can't choose a specific person now. I hangout with people often and generally they dress somewhat similarly to me and they probably would dress however I asked...
              
              <p><strong>92. What kind of store would you like to have if you were to open one in the future?</strong><br>
              I'd never really want to run a physical store or anything, but well, I want to keep running zines and sell more that appeal to my peers. I also would love to do art for lolita brands and events more often, but I would probably have to make an EGL art account on Instagram which I haven't been able to convince myself to do.</p>
              
              <p><strong>93. When looking at lolita, your eyes will go straight to this motif. What is it?</strong><br>
              Crosses.</p>
              
              <p><strong>94. Do you want your child to be a Lolita too?</strong><br>
              I want my sisters to dress in lolita and this is probably the closest I'll ever get to having a child so I guess yes.</p>
              
              <p><strong>95. How much can I spend on one loli outfit?</strong><br>
              I usually don't buy things with a specific outfit in mind, but I'm sure it can easily go over $600 including all my accessories and my shoes and the dress itself. </p>
              
              <p><strong>96. This is quintessentially Lolita! Is there a certain gesture that makes you think this.</strong><br>
              Holding a parasol... with a bit of poise.. Quitessentially lolita.</p>
              
              <p><strong>97. I want to wear that once in my life! Do you ever think that about any style other than lolita?</strong><br>
              I want to try Elegant Gothic Aristocrat someday, and I'm honestly sure I will. But, outside of the scope of lolita magazines, perhaps Cult Party Kei or Pink House.</p>
              
              <p><strong>98. Looking at your Lolita collection or style, what one word would you use to sum it up?</strong><br>
              Ecelectic.</p>
              
              <p><strong>99. What is your ideal Lolita image?</strong><br>
              I wear a variety of things, but I do feel happiest in gothic. I feel like a beautiful elegant lady.</p>
              
              <p><strong>100. Thank you very much! Please give us your impression of answering 100!</strong><br>
              It was really fun. I need more questionairres. I can't believe it's almost been exactly a year since I've updated this. I did this on a whim haha.</p>
