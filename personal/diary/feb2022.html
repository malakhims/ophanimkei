TITLE: two week notice soon maybe

BODY:
<div>Considering putting in my two week notice and looking for a new job. Host work is really exhausting. It's a job that relies on talking to people and complete control of the dining room. Exhaustion is getting to me, and I've been having anxiety attacks and meltdowns regularly. My primary issue is that I don't have my driver's license yet. An accurate timeline for getting it would be in March-April after my in person driver's lessons. It will be a bit late since I go to college in July.. After that I hope to look for a retail or warehouse or computer repair job.</div><div><br>My last meltdown resulted in my mother looking into Asperger's Syndrome which she now believes I have. It is now just called Autism Spectrum Disorder or 'on the spectrum' colloquially, but I did some looking into the autism vs aspie side of things and honestly Asperger's as a term seems very useful to people who consider themselves aspies. I had a lot of fun looking at aspergirls. I related a lot. Mother plans to take me to get evaluated. If she follows through, this could potentially be a very big positive change in my life. Accommodations..</div><div><br></div><div>I should also note I've left every single server I was in because of my meltdown! Very cool. Whoops. I haven't felt an aching in my heart or anything other than the call from the void (commit suicide and no one will know!) Aside from the presence of The Void, the silence in my notifications is appreciated. Tomorrow I am trying to go out with a friend which will be nice.</div><div><br>That's all for today. Heading to a doctor's appointment. Time to get my blood checked and see if my anemia has finally fucked me up. Hurray!<br><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://malakhim.blog.fc2.com/img/yotsutired.png/" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog-imgs-142.fc2.com/m/a/l/malakhim/yotsutired.png" alt="yotsu tired" style="width: 95px;"></a><br></div>

<div>tomorrow i will do my driver's simulation! my ipad will arrive. methinks i will start coding devil's food again, from the ground up while not home. will try to mostly stick to Ommatophilia but it seems like a good side project since rpg maker can't run on ios and i can't code outside the program. :-)<br><br>i am excited. i never make big purchases for myself. methinks this will make my workflow much better and allow me to work on thing when i am not feeling well enough to get my&nbsp; entire drawing set up together.</div><div><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://malakhim.blog.fc2.com/img/yotsusing.png/" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog-imgs-142.fc2.com/m/a/l/malakhim/yotsusing.png" alt="yotsusing" style="width: 120px;"></a></div>
