    <br><br>
    I'm in the office right now. I've made several attempts to write this entry throughout the day, but I was doing other things and multitasking did not work out. My sisters called me and forced me to play Roblox for two hours and the call itself lasted three hours. They got laptops for Christmas because they get a lot of schoolwork on the computer, and it came with Microsoft teams. I set it up so that they can call and/or text me at anytime. It's been delightful, however, it's a bit exhausting to have calls everyday that last for substantial periods of time.
    <br><br>    
    I feel as though I've been neglecting my website. I'd like to make OC pages again and update my art archive, but I'm just so tired. It feels my brain is always yawning. I'm back at school now after 3ish weeks off, but I don't feel reenergized. But. I will persevere.
    <br><br>
    I have new items and images. And because my life is very boring outside of lolita, most of this entry will consist of me talking about that.

    I got this bustier and this HeartE coat. The HeartE coat is absolutely delightful. It's got little angel buttons. I didn't even notice that when I bought it. It felt like the stars aligned because I woke up and immediately saw these things for sale. While I do have a coat, it's a 2009ish Baby the Stars Shine Bright coat. It looks very warm, but it is not warm enough to withstand the coldness of the area I'm currently in. The other day I was walking and I thought I was going to freeze to death. The Heart E coat is much warmer, and also it's a lot more casual than my beautiful fluffy BTSSB coat.

    Um. um. So. I checked the lolita server I'm in just now and.

    I saw two beautiful cutsews.. and bought them.. I was going to go on no buy because I was saving up for the BTSSB babydoll jsk, but. Well. Two beautiful cutsews. I've been trying to gather clothes for the summer (I don't know why I'm so fixated on summer when it's cold as fuck and I really should be focusing on winter). 
    <br><br>
    Anyway, I also have a new hobby. When I was a kid, I got an American Girl doll. I've been really tempted by BJDs, but I decided I would  just focus on my American Girl doll instead since I already own her and she's very expensive. I bought her a dress that's really similar to mine and took some pictures with her in the library.

    It was so fun. I love getting new hobbies. Now I want to learn how to sew so I can make her more dresses... ;w; but it's... hard to get into things that are difficult.
    <br><br>
    Anyway, I have nothing else to say. I'm very tired. Please hope I do not buy more things!
