<div>my isp blocked fc2 for a little while which sucked (or my ip address was blocked by fc2). now it's not as evident by me posting this.</div><div><br></div><div>catching up. last post was just me coping with anxiety. venting made me feel a bit more normal again.<br></div><div><br></div><div>a few days i released my demo of my rpg maker game Ommatophilia. a few of my friends beta tested which was nice. i try not to pay attention to the analytics section of itchio to avoid giving myself an anxiety attack. the last time i checked it was doing well.. rather scary, being perceived. it makes me realize i don't think i want to be popular. i don't know. i like to exist in my own little bubble and not be perceived.. it is comfy, but also, dopamine from twitter likes is nice. it's a constant struggle... i think if i get popular, i will have to accept it and just try not to panic about it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>i got a critique for Ommatophilia.. i don't think i care for it too much because the thing they critiqued was a bit intentional but it did give me some thoughts about my game direction. we'll see where it goes.</div><div><br></div><div>my antipsychotic has been nice, but my mood spikes have been replaced by a constant anxiety about everything. i think every night i panic about my time in seattle and all the things surrounding it. it has truly clouded my thoughts and makes living way less fun. i'm hoping the new med i'm starting tomorrow helps and therapy.<br></div><div><br></div><div>i also get anxiety about other things like car lights outside my window, planes being too close, the idea of going to an amusement park, school, neocities, deciding to purchase a website domain, etc etc. the little anxiety gets stomped by the post traumatic stress Episodes, but it is still constant and persistent. i hope it calms down soon.</div><div><br></div><div>i am hoping writing it all out helps a little. not being able to log onto fc2 made me very anxious.. i didn't really want to switch to using my website as a blog again.. i like using fc2 a lot. it's grown on me. at first i thought fc2 was down for everyone, but then i asked a friend and they told me it worked for them. i went through the fc2 tag on twitter and people were updating just fine. i downloaded opera momentarily to check with its vpn (don't do that it's not safe) and fc2 worked then. i considered buying nordvpn or something but i couldn't justify it. the app worked on my phone and ipad so i thought about buying a keyboard.. could not justify it either.<br></div><div><br></div><div>not having a job is really hard.. it's hard to budget. i miss being able to spend money a bit more.. freely though not spending money brings me joy, in a self punishing kind of way. i'm considering buying ringfit but it'd be a bit investment, however, i really enjoyed it when i had access to the game and it helped get me moving. i want to start exercising to combat my tiredness.</div><div><br></div><div>that's all really. i feel okay when i'm not anxious (but most of the time i am anxious.) praying new med helps and that the therapist i called gets back to me soon. <br></div><div><br></div><div>did i mention i called a therapist? the wait time for her is about two weeks. i could probably find another therapist faster but i have a good feeling about this one so i'm willing to wait it out... hopefully the meds help me in the meantime, even it just puts me to sleep after taking it so that i'm not up all night dealing with the constant nightmares and panic.<br></div><div><br></div><div>thank you for your time. goodnight <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>

BODY:
<div>I got new glasses! And my hair was straightened and curled. I feel fresh and new.</div><div><br></div><div>I struggle with straight hair. It's very hard for me to take care of when it's straightened. It gets fluffy very quickly because I'm so bad at keeping it dry and tying it up at night. I tend to lose the things i need to keep my hair in or something of the other. It's a bit of pain, but I get so many compliments. It's truly delightful.</div><div><br></div><div>This will likely be the last time I get it straightened for quite some time. In college it will be in braids mostly due to the longevity of braids. I hope to have purple and black box braids for my first quarter of college, but I doubt it will matter much by then. I am still very anxious about college.. I worry my wording is very robotic at the moment. I'm so sleepy.&nbsp; I was woken up this morning fora&nbsp; surprise hair appointment, and I'm still getting through the grog. It's 2 o'clock now. I don't think a nap would be worth it despite me Really wanting to take one.</div><div><br>Tonight, I will be sending off my cousin to prom. Tomorrow, my family and I will go out to breakfast for my sister's birthday and mother's day I guess. It's my dad's birthday too. Too many gifts right? I actually can not afford it :D So I can't give everyone gifts. I'm not really sure what to do actually. In theory&nbsp; I could just give my dad and mom one gift and find something nice for my youngest sister or give her a drawing or candy. She loses many physical gifts so I actually would prefer to just doodle her something. <br></div><div><br></div><div>But in order to make a gift, i need to wake up :'D Which is impossible!! I'm so sleepy.</div><div><br></div><div>I have to pass out now or at least stop sitting in one place. It was fun. New hair new glasses new me!!!<br></div><div><br></div><div>PS: I want to try to include more pictures in this blog.. when i go out and stuff.. Look forward to that<br></div>

BODY:
<div>Today&nbsp; is my dad's and my sister's birthday as well as mother's day. My family ate breakfast together, something we don't do often. Mother cooked it.. I wish I'd been awake to help, but I slept until 12pm today. I wish I wasn't so drowsy all the time.</div><div><br></div><div>We went to see Sonic 2. It was an entertaining movie and exactly what I expected, which isn't bad or anything. Its cute moments were nice. I wonder how the movie will age. It had a reference to flossing which caught me off guard. The CGI was really nice mostly. There was a very big robot. I support artists animating robots. The movie had the vibe of the original transformers.. The going back and forth between jokes, action, government, brief emotional moments.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Once again, I am horribly tired, so I may seem robotic and repetitive. I napped but it did not give me my energy back. In fact, it seems to have dragged me deeper into the abyss. I'm babysitting now, as per usual. It's a good thing I'm awake because I really don't want to ruin my sleeping schedule more. Still, I wish I didn't get drowsy in the afternoon of Every Single Day.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to do something fun or nice or work on my game, but the drowsiness.. I got my zoloft today. My psych told me it helps with sleep but I'm perplexed... It says to take it in the morning. I am not sure if I should listen to the bottle or not. I don't want to be awake all night tonight if it gives me energy.. Ahh</div><div><br></div><div>I'm.. so tired. It was fun writing.<br></div>

It's strange how such utterly terrifying feelings can also be considered a nuisance by another part of you. I feel like I'm cut into many pieces, and we are all experiences different things. I have finally reached some clarity regarding this situation. I hope to address it in therapy soon- my feelings, my actions, my inaction, my fear, how I let those things happen... How I should've expressed my doubts sooner but I didn't trust myself.</span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: small;">I have a lot of flaws that lead to me allowing people to play savior for me..

<div>Last night I woke up at 1am. I was up until 4am, anxious as usual. At some point I realized I was unable to cry and that I didn't remember the last time I had cried.</div><div><br></div><div>It's truly bizarre. I am someone who cries pretty frequently and easily, but I guess medication has made it far more difficult. It kind of feels like I'm missing something. Like, a&nbsp; lot of my stress could go away if I could just tear up. Ironically as I write this, I am tearing up because I can not stop yawning.</div><div><br></div><div>Today, I am babysitting as per usual. My dad is supposed to be here but he is working at a different time than usual. I'm listening to city pop while my brother sleeps. Sitting on the bedroom floor is so nice. <br></div><div><br></div><div>My brother took his first steps last night. I am happy I was here to see. It was very cute. He's walking more today.. He's so excited to grow up. Slow down little guy please.. I'm going to be leaving soon. I'm going to miss so much of your growth. You're moving too fast already.</div><div><br></div><div>I applied for two zines.. The competition for them is high, so i'm not really sure if I'll get in. It'd be nice to have my art printed again, but I won't count on it.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm still feeling anxious.. Writing here is so scary lately, but I still really enjoy it. My dear FC2. I reread my old entries and it was a bit embarrassing. I jump to conclusions so quickly sometimes. I hate being so unstable. My meds have allowed me to have a bit more clarity with my decisions.. Though I wonder if the anxiety is worse because of my meds sometimes.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm struggling lately with motivation for things.. I sometimes want to give up on doing anything and go to sleep. Today is one of those days.. I'd be sleeping if I wasn't babysitting. I know I need to fix my diet and start going outside to get more energy, but it's horribly difficult. Even writing this entry is a bit of a slog.</div><div><br></div><div>I got on my website and compressed all the thumbnails in my portfolio. Now it loads faster. Yay.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm. tired.<br></div>

BODY:
<div>I bought an iPad keyboard.</div><div><br></div><div>It truly is a game changer if I can adjust. It was a bit of an impulse buy so I’m very anxious as it was a bit pricy. I’m typing this entry from the comfort of my bed with my iPad in my lap like a tiny laptop. My thumbs hurt a bit from the small amount of hand-space.</div><div><br></div><div>I look forward to traveling without my laptop more often. &nbsp;I’ve really grown to hate my laptop i think. It’s bulky and exhausting to carry. Laptops feel built to break. My iPad i’ve grown comfortable with. It’s ultimately why i bought a keyboard for it.</div><div><br></div><div>I am not in a typing mood now so I am feeling buyer’s remorse, but i know when i want to code or go outside while my sisters’ play and work on my projects, it will be great. I look forward to it. I’m tired now though. The anxiety is still very constant and exhausting.. I will sleep through it..</div>

TITLE: I Talk About A Book


DATE: 05/18/2022 11:15:10
BODY:
<div><span style="font-size: small;">I’ve been reading a book called The Hunger by Alma Katsu. It was in a google drive of books a friend sent me. It’s been really entertaining though it’s always awkward to read books set in the 1800s about white settlers. This is specifically about the Donner Party incident with a supernatural twist. I’m curious to see where it goes, and it’s nice to read a bit every night. I started yesterday. When I was young, I was someone &nbsp;who would finish books in a day.&nbsp;</span></div><p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">To be honest, I kind of miss it but reading a little bit gives me time to digest. I don’t feel the need to finish books at the rate I used to. There’s no need really, especially when I have other hobbies. I hope to join a book club in college though I guess I’ll have to buy books then. Buying books.. I wish I could drive. I’d love to go to the library.</span><br></span></p><p><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size: small;">College is frightening, but trying to keep busy by reading, exercising, etc etc keeps me feeling alive. I don’t even have time to focus on my trauma when I’m trying to take care of myself. It’s nice c:</span></span></p><p><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size: small;">Also, I’m getting better at typing on the ipad. Purchase justified! Tomorrow I hangout with a friend. I’m excited to tell her I’m reading again.</span></span></p>

BODY:
<div><span style="font-size: 14px;">I’ve got a horrible headache.</span></div><p>I’ve been considering privating all of my entries and switching back to using a journal though typing is far easier. I feel like I’m getting self conscious about updating so often. But, I have an iPad keyboard and a cute FC2, it’d be a shame to not use them out of self consciousness..</p><p>Though in reality, I feel some fear my entries are being read by a malevolent entity who’s using these entries to justify their hatred of me. I’m really anxious about it, but I really love my FC2. I don’t want my fear to stop me from updating here.</p><p>I went out with a friend today. We went to our local dying mall. One of the stores was completely silent. I remarked that it seemed abandoned. When that mall dies, I will grieve a bit. I remember when it was alive in my youth. So many stores are gone now.</p><p>My entries are getting more mundane, but this is nice for me. I hope I give off less extreme mental illness as time goes on. I’m keeping busy, reading, working out. I hope I can stay active though I worry this is just one of those little phases.</p><p>But it’s okay if it’s a phase. Everyone has phases. That’s part of life. But, I truly feel like my life might be getting better. Reading really makes me happy. I’m on a three day streak c: Apple books gives me little notifications when I read my reading goals. It doesn’t even feel like a slog.</p><p>My main struggle is that I chose a pretty bad book to start off with. Hunger by Alma Katsu is.. I’ll give my thoughts when finished. I’ll probably put it on my website rather than FC2 though it’d be fun to convert this to an actual blog rather than Ophanim screaming though.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Maybe in the end this will convert to a blog and I’ll go back to journalling. I’m not sure yet. I have a Yume Nikki journal an old friend gave me. I’ve only been using it for story ideas so far, but maybe I should just.. Get back into writing out my feelings on paper.</span><br></p>

<div>It’s easier to not know what’s going on.&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>I wish I hadn’t done that. I clicked on the app and my IG account just.. Logged into itself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe I’ll just delete it. Life is better without it. Yeah.. I’ll just delete it. I deleted it just now. It’s very freeing to be gone.</div><div><br></div><div>I have therapy in an hour and a half. I’m not really sure what I’ll talk about. I had a dream about my ex roommates. Normally, that’d ruin me, but now I just feel.. Not real. I’m not ruined.. Just not present.</div><div><br></div><div>I still have post traumatic stress. Before I deleted my Instagram, I saw the seen notification in my dm from my last conversation with an old friend from Seattle. It was very bad for me to see. It frightened me. I need to sleep.</div>

BODY:
<div>Today I did not do much. Allergies have turned me into slime. Zyrtec does nothing. This is bizarre. It should. I’m taking flonase too, but it takes a while to get in your system.</div><div><br></div><div>I babysat all day which is still not very much to me. I used to find it exhausting but now it’s just.. part of life. I’m okay with it.</div><div><br></div><div>My school keeps advertising bed sheets and dorm stuff to me. I think I am getting excited. I’m also mortified. I worry about my siblings growing up without me, but I’ll call and be able to visit semi frequently.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I have a cousin who lives a few states away. She told me she still feels close to home because of things like FaceTime. It’s easier now more than ever to see people’s faces even if you aren’t with them. She talked about how awful Skype used to be, but she still used it back in the day. I remember the horrors of Skype.</div><div><br></div><div>My brother walks to me when I leave him on the floor. He wraps his arms around my legs. I’m not sure what I did to make him love me so much. I worry about what will happen when I leave. I realize it’s inevitable. I can’t just stay here forever. I mean, I could. I’d just be sacrificing a lot. In truth, part of me does want to stay until he’s about 2 or 3 years old to get him attached to me, but I can not put my life on hold for the little guy. At least i’ll be here for his first birthday.</div><div><br></div><div>Eventually, I think I’ll try to study abroad, so.. This is something I have to get used to. I will be leaving more often. I want to travel the world, feel the wind in my hair, and all that jazz. Today, I felt it again, the vitality I felt when I planned to visit my friends in Japan, when I started my website, when I applied to college.. It’s very rare that I feel it now, but when I do, I hold onto it tightly. I have to remember it when I feel like I will crumble into little pieces.</div><div><br></div><div>My goals get really murky with my anxiety clouding my emotions, but when I do remember them.. When I feel that desire to travel again, to go to Japan, to major in Computer Science, to be an honors student.. I am alive :-)</div>

BODY:
<div>I’ve made an effort to learn JavaScript again by reading Eloquent JavaScript. I find it entertaining. I’m excited to get farther into it. I got to chapter 2 today. I’m taking it slowly- there is no rush and it allows me to digest information. I technically know everything i’ve read already. I’m excited to actually make little programs. When I get to Chapter 20 and work with node.js, that will be fun. I want to finally bite into the forbidden fruit that is programming.</div><div><br></div><div>To be honest, I’m more interested in backend development.. I just.. I don’t know why I’m so set on learning JavaScript. Maybe I should major in web development instead. I’m not sure. I know I can use JavaScript with Twine and maybe do some fun stuff on my website though I think I’ll do some interesting stuff with Github pages. I want to recode my portfolio site in it’s entirety. Not sure what I’ll do yet though.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ll think of some ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, I’ve been thinking about getting into writing again. Artblock is killing me. Writing could be comforting… I feel like I’ve had very little motivation to do it in the past few years outside of game and comic writing. Now I want to actually work on a novel. I had a dream about a book I was reading and thought it was good. Then I woke up and decided to write it.</div><div><br></div><div>Wish me luck!</div>

<div>Lately, I've felt haunted by my childhood.&nbsp; I wish I hadn't been so mean when I was 10 years old.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, writing that statement makes me realize it's ridiculous to be haunted by something that happened almost 9 years ago but I feel it in my bones sometimes. Fear that the actions of my childhood will catch up to me. It's okay. It's okay.</div><div><br></div><div>I've been trying to learn JavaScript lately. It makes me really tired, but I enjoy it. It is like a very large puzzle. I can't wait to get to React. I just want to start doing web dev instead of coding calculators and chessboards. I don't know what I'll do yet though. Lately I've been feeling fresh out of ideas. I drew something yesterday and it was a miracle.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm bordering the line between okay and not okay a lot lately. Soon I will increase my zoloft dosage and hopefully that will make me okay... <br></div><div><br></div><div>I want to write more, but like i said, I've been fresh out of ideas and I've been lacking interest in things I normally love. It's a shame. Maybe I'll tackle CSS grids or something while I'm feeling so out of it.<br></div>
