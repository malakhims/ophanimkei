            A lot has happened since I last updated. I went home and hung out with family. We ate together. We all talked about college. We went to the fair. I ate a funnel cake. It was yummy.
            <br><br>
            I watched my grandad get buried. I'm tearing up thinking about it. I'll never see him again.

            The funeral was nice. People told stories. My grandad told my granny's mother that he couldn't get enough of her and that he wanted to marry her. He took care of everyone in my family. I hope he's okay, wherever he is.
            <br><br>
            I want to write more. It feels inappropriate. Now is time for silence.
