    <img src="/images/emojis/cat.gif" height="90px" style="float:left;padding-right:10px;">what's up! i forgot to mention in any of my diary entries that i'd be going on a cruise during the final week of june. it was not my choice though i am grateful of course. hopefully this is the last cruise i experience in my life though. haha. being stuck in the middle of the ocean with no internet is not exactly my idea of fun, especially when most of the fun my family members in my age group were having consisted of drinking and night life. i'm a very boring person as you know (no partying, no drinking, no staying up late unless i'm doing art or suffering from insomnia). i got designated to watching my siblings after they fell asleep so my parents could go out and have fun since i would be asleep or playing tears of the kingdom. 
    <br><br>
    i did do things i enjoyed though... i liked to eat. i ate lots of good food. also, we had 3 we stopped at. the first one i did not enjoy. it was in the dominican republic. we just.. were at a pool. my cousin made a seat for me at the bar, but the pool water felt disgusting to me. i got out and got back on the cruise then worked on a website commission while i had internet. the next stop was in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I really loved it. colonialism sucked for the world but boy could Europeans design beautiful structures (though i'm struggling to identify who actually built san cristobal? was it slaves? was it spanish workers? who knows?)

    wait be right back i'm going to take a nap.
