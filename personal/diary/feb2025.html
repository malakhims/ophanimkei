    <img src="/images/emojis/tomoko.jpg" width="33%" style="float:left;margin-right:6px;"> hello everyone. i'm tired. i'm. tired. i don't really want to update this blog anymore. neocities was fun. all of this was fun, but it was just a failed learning exercise for a shitty schizophrenic. i'll update necessities here sometimes. none of this matters anymore though. i'll be moving over to fc2 probably unless it locks me out i guess. i don't really feel like dealing with any of this anymore. have you noticed i've gotten too lazy to update my media logs?
    <br><br>
    soon my excuse for holding on to all of this will be gone and i can finally disappear. the ultimate plan is to leave most of this behind. just post art when i want to share it. stop hosting zines. stop sharing thoughts on social media. don't log into discord. keep very few lines of communication open. everything i say is misintepreted. why talk in this world where i exist on the other side of a glass wall? i'm so very tired. soon this will all be over and i can finally rest. i'm so tired. what will become of my clothes? my art? my games? friends? zines? who's to say?

    <br><br>
    i wish all my close friends didn't move on. i wish i didn't so often realize people i view as close don't care about me as much as i thought they did. but it's okay. 
    <br><br>
    I'm never close with my coworkers or people in friend groups I hangout with. I'm just kind of here. I wonder what's wrong with me? Am I too cynical? Am I too rude? Too blunt? Do I need to hold my tongue? Do I not reach out enough? Are my interests too niche? Do I talk too much? Too little?I don't understand. it all confuses me. I'm tired of living behind this glass wall. I thought I wanted to stay in this town forever because I have friends here, but to be honest, I just feel lonelier than ever lately. I don't know what to do. This loneliness will never go away I feel. It will follow me throughout my life. 
    <br><br>
    I think I might be missing something that makes me human. I have empathy and everything. I enjoy listening to others, but I feel  like i've lost the ability to truly connect. Like.. i talk to others, but people make plans without me. i am sometimes invited to close friend events, but even then, everyone is kind of dancing together on a spider web and I'm just finding myself falling through the gaps. 
    <br><br>
    Am I human? Is it possible for me to hold hands with another and smile? Can I truly feel what someone else feels in that moment? Do moments I view as significant between me and another matter as much to the other person? Will the moments I hold dear constantly be ripped away from me? I'm so very tired. I wish this were all so much simpler. 
    <br><br>
    Giving up on my friendships would be silly, but I'm tired of leaving my room. I just want to stay here and play video games.. Watch TV. I watched a Sonic OVA featuring Hyper Metal Sonic. It was so nice. I cried afterwards because the loneliness came back, but for a while I could almost see myself in this colorful world ful of simple shaped characters and nice music..

    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiwXnjTXYAAMqDo?format=jpg&name=4096x4096" width="47%" style="float:left;margin-right:6px;">hello. my head hurts really bad, but i'm okay. i'm very tired. my period started two days ago, and it's doing a number on me T_T. messy and bleegh. tired. i've been drawing though. it's been fun. 
    <br><br> 
    i've been drawing as evidenced by art on left. for some reason brain said 'you need to draw kie getting strangled with your kanuko pen RIGHT NOW."
    <br><br>
    i really wanted to paint in my watercolor sketchbook, but this vision.. it's bad to ignore inspiration. probably. i don't know. LOL. well, i haven't been posting finished art pieces lately, but i'd like to go scan them in the library tomorrow. it's just.i  always draw really close to the spirals. i know  it'd probably be smart to put tape around the borders, so that that doesn't happen but.. i'm lazy. smiles.
    <br><br>
    i don't know why. so i'd need to edit them out lol. i don't know if i'll post any of my trad art. i tend to throw it on Patreon and sometimes this diary and friend discords and personal accounts, but haven't actively been posting it on my main socials haha. i just.. know it won't do well and that bothers me :P. 
    <br><br>
    it's technically the 2nd because it's only 1am by the way. my sleep schedule is messed up because iwas up all day yesterday unbraiding my hair. though i knowi can go to sleep right now. my period makes it so that i can just keep sleeping forever lmao. it drains my life force. my friend was telling me how birth control stopped their period, and it kind of appeals to me. i have a lot of fears of getting pregnant against my will and not being able to do much about it, so it'd ease both of those worries. but also. i know weight gain can happen and some other hormonal stuff. i get a lot of anxiety abt messing with anything in my body since i'm already so fucked up you know lol.
    <br><br>
    and it kinda feels weird to start bc as a lesbian... 
    <br><br>
    sidenote: i've been watching trigun. it's very fantastic and has managed to completely enrapture me. i'm on episode 16 or 17. i'll be reading the manga afterwards. Vash is so cute. I understand him. 
    <br><br>
    WARRIOR OF LOVE AND PEACE!
