    <b>May 18th - 日本！わくわく</b>
    <hr>
    <sub>sidenote from 6.14.24 mala: wrote this in Japan but was gonna scrap it!! decided to upload it because why not lawl.</sub>
    <br><br>I am currently in Japan. I have been here since May 12th. You may be wondering. You with your obsession with updating your website, your vanity, and your shameless gofundme page hasn't updated  your blog despite being in Japan for a week. What gives?
    <br><br>
    I doubt anyone is actually thinking that, but I do feel bad. I want to document everything thoroughly. I need to write down my thoughts as I experience them, but the last thing I want to do while in Japan is pull out my phone while I'm reflecting on everything I see around me. I'm currently on a fifty minute train ride, so this seemed like the perfect time to pull out my iPad and type up my feelings.
    <br><br>
    My first five days in Japan, I hardly ate anything. I mostly subsided on onigiri from konbinis and red bean buns. This was because I'd not want to spend time going to eat and my mind was preoccupied. I noticed my mood was kind of lower than it should be. I ate some noodles from some places, but I couldn't eat a lot of them as my body does not get along with carbohydrates.
    <br><br>
    Last night, I went to ホルモン酒場 蔵屋 and I ate とんぺい焼き (tonpenyaki). It was the happiest I've been the entire trip. A lot of the anxiety I felt melted away as I spoke to the staff with my poor Japanese, and I think having a full belly helped me calm down. I now realize the importance of eating a hot meal regularly. You can not survive on snacks and carbohydrates.
    <br><br>
    I've gone to Laforet Harajuku. I went on my second day (like a fool) and bought way too much stuff. I spent an ungodly amount actually.. About what I spent at Nightshade. I have no regrets. 
    <br><br>
    I bought an OP from Majoh, and the babydoll JSK and bunny headpiece from BTSSB (one dream dress acquired.) I got a parasol from Miho Matsuda, a headpiece from Metamorphose, and I think that was it (sorry AtePie and Angelic Pretty). Don't calculate how much that is please.
    <br><br>
    I'm actually wearing the Majoh OP right now. I'll be uploading this blog after I reunite with my laptop this evening, so hopefully I can include an image
    <br><br>
    <sub>i didn't because i'm lazy</sub>
    <br><br>
    Oh I visited Senso-ji. It was cool. Very beautiful. I went to the shrine and prayed for a life full of happiness and adventure then got my fortune. I got the Best Fortune which made me so happy. I felt this deep sense of peace there (despite the chaos from the crowd). I also bought talisman.
    <br><br>
    About to get off train…
    <br><br>
    <b>Later</b>
    <br><br> Kamakura was beautiful. I will include photos. At one of the temples, mothers who experienced miscarriages would go to pray and leave small statues. I almost cried. Almost. It was a lot. Pregnancy is one of my biggest fears, but I do love children. I just can't imagine what I'd do if me or a family member miscarried.
    <br><br>
    I am now on my own solo trip to Yokohoma (Shopping Log anyone)? I have no idea what I'll do there to be honest other than go to Closetchild. A friend told me the mall has anime pop up shops… I'll explore some then head home. 
    <br><br>
    I'm listening to some Eastern European post punk and vibing on the train. Despite so much happening, I almost feel as though I have very little to discuss. Perhaps I need a meal in my tummy before my brain can outpour thoughts. I don't know.
    <br><br>
    I'll close my ipad and chill on the train now. Love you.
