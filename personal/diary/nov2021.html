BODY:
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Okay so it's important for me to get used to budgeting. I get paid for the first time this Saturday. I must make up for the last 2 months of me doing nothing and also after seeing how poor budgeting goes for other people.. It is now more important to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: small;">My goals for this paycheck are the following:</span><br></p>

<ul><li><span style="font-size: small;"> Nintendo Switch Yearly Subscription ($20) </span></li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-size: small;"> Food ($20 at most- primarily for things for my rice cooker)</span></li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-size: small;"> Good Deals ($50- should not spend this much)</span></li></ul>
  
  
  
<ul>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">The point is to be frugal. 10% of my paycheck will go to something specific. I am not focusing on savings right now because I'm going to college and to be honest- college debt will wipe me out. My goal is to have enough money for the Steam deck by Q2 of next year and $1.5k saved up for a trip in the summer.. On the trip I'd like to be frugal so that I have money leftover but we'll see.</span></p><p><font size="2">This should be an efficient plan. Once a month I'd like to make a big silly purchase- my big silly purchase for this month is planned already so wish me luck. I am also hoping to start biking to the store but my mom doesn't think it's very safe.. But I refuse to uber to buy rice -_-</font></p><p><font size="2">Now I am going to make a big rice cooker pancake. Wish me Luck!</font></p></ul><p style="text-align: center; "><a href="https://malakhim.blog.fc2.com/img/madotsuki4_yn.webp/" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog-imgs-142.fc2.com/m/a/l/malakhim/madotsuki4_yn.webp" alt="mado umbrella" style="width: 95px;"></a><br></p>

BODY:
<div>What are the reasons to kill yourself? I exist wrong- there is nothing for me here.<br><br>Do you feel love from other people? I feel love from other people, but I can't express it. I'm always angry. I'm very evil. I hurt people and I'm very flawed. If people could see my insides, they would know I am unlovable. I can't share my thoughts with people. It'll hurt them.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you have hope for the future? I do have a bit of hope. I always have a bit of hope, but it is always crushed. I don't wanna be optimistic anymore. It just hurts me more.</div><div><br></div><div>Is the problem me? The problem is me. I don't want to deal with me anymore.</div><div><br></div><div>Is the problem them? The problem is me. I don't want them to deal with me anymore.</div><div><br></div><div>Would they miss you? Yes, but the world would go on. I will become the person you used to talk to who vanished someday or the black sheep of the family who killed themselves.</div><div><br>Do you deserve to die? Maybe.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you deserve to live? I am not sure.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you love yourself? I only love myself when I think about how sick I am.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you hate yourself? I wish I didn't.</div><div><br></div><div>Do other people hate you? I wish they did.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you have a plan? I'm too scared to kill myself, but I do know how. I have a plan.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you want to die? I think so.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Do you want to live? I think so.</div><div><br></div><div>Are you scared of hell? Not anymore</div>

And I have one headshot commission to finish from a friend.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm getting better. I had a chocolate souffle today. I bought holiday fragrances while they were on sale. I'm saving okay. I cut the bad things off of me and an analyzing the remains. Things weren't the best. It's good that that time is over.</div><div><br></div><div>Very tired.
