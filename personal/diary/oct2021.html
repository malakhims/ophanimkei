Someone broke a promise to me recently and didn't acknowledge it. I doubt they remember.</div><div><br></div><div>My appetite is gone again. I guess I am thankful. It's nice to not be hungry.</div><div><br></div><div>You always think people know you but they don't. and the things you know about them are just painful to you. The world is full of spikes. There's no escape really. We are all running from something.

BODY:
<div>I'm leaving Seattle and going to my old home.</div><div><br>I don't really know how to feel. I tried to stay longer but they wanted me to leave. I don't know.. I don't know. I don't know how to feel or what to do. I hurt them both so much that they need me to leave.. But this was inevitable right? We all need space but we are in such close proximity.. Thin walls.&nbsp; I'm happy I can go home I think. I just want to see a doctor as soon as possible. My health declined So rapidly here- much faster than at home.. And maybe things get worse before they get better, but it's scary... I'm terrified of being sick, especially when it starts affecting my physical health.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm underweight now.. I get migraines. My schizo symptoms are worse.. I have to go home. My sisters will make me happy. They'll heal me form this pain for a while, and I care about them.. So many people care about me. It's really overwhelming. It makes me feel selfish.. I like to have friends to avoid overwhelming people, and I like to make others happy.. I have to do that from a distance right? To keep myself from getting hurt? And to avoid hurting others? Or do we accept the hurt that will happen to us? Do people ever get close to each other without hurting the other person badly? I&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I have many people who make me happy now, and I make others happy too. I am doing things now. I have a support system. I won't die without them. I thought I did but I know I will be okay, and they'll be okay too. I never felt like I knew what was going on here... I'm so sick. I dissociate. I'm suffering a lot. And coming here let me think, am I doing something wrong by leaving?</div><div><br></div><div>They asked me to leave... I tried to stay longer but they asked me to leave.. I would've extended the time by two months.. But they asked me to leave.. And I still love them but I keep asking myself "why am i leaving now?" And I keep thinking "they asked me to leave."</div><div><br></div><div>I don't know how badly you can hurt someone. I don't know. I tried to stay longer but it wasn't enough. I kept getting sick. I keep getting sicker. I tried to stay longer. I tried I tried but it wasn't enough.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>On the plane,&nbsp; I will write or go to sleep I guess. I hope the plane stays in the sky. I hope I can see my sisters. I hope I can see my hometown, my grandmother. I hope I can get a job and get therapy. I hope my family and friends can forgive me someday.</div><div><br></div><div>I don't want to rely on people anymore or use people as bandaids. I want to get a job, get therapy, get help. I have to heal on my own.. I want a support system but I don't need to rely on people as heavily as I relied on them.. No one deserves that pain on them. I'm sorry for relying on you so much. I hope you can heal. Our friendship was unsustainable.. I knew that long ago.. I should've worked on it before coming.. My stomach is hurting and I can't eat.</div><div><br></div><div>I just.. I need to sleep.. I can't keep packing.. I have to sleep..</div><div><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://malakhim.blog.fc2.com/img/20210716113334568.webp/" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog-imgs-142.fc2.com/m/a/l/malakhim/20210716113334568.webp" alt="yotsu lay" style="width: 120px;"></a><br></div>

<div>In the end I realized I'm afraid and I have been for a long time. I'm afraid of everyone and constantly fall into this trap.. I am mentally ill.. And I fall into this trap over and over.</div><div><br></div><div>I don't understand anything.. Why did ??? let that happen? Why didn't ??? realize that was too much for me? I knew something like this would happen. Am I being pessimistic now? It's just.. I knew. I knew it was unnerving it was and everyone was lying.. It triggered my psychotic break but it feels like it's not even being treated seriously... Do ??? you know what paranoia is like? Going in and out of lucidity and only feeling tension????</div><div><br></div><div>Being psychotic feels so embarrassing.. Because you're always embarrassed! When you're being irrational? And No one knows how to take care of you unless they're a professional?</div><div><br>How can something I do be unfair if I didn't know all the circumstances? Am I playing victim again? It hurt my feelings a lot.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm hurting so bad, but it feels like no one understands what I'm saying.. Two months isn't a long time.. But it is when you're watching your cousin go through high school.. It is when you're missing your siblings grow.. It is when your time with someone you care about it is limited. And I think I expressed these concerns before? Maybe I did? I don't remember.</div><div><br>I told you what I was experiencing and everyone shrugs it off over and over and over. And it fucking hurt. Schizo symptoms ruined my high school years and you know?&nbsp; And it feels like... It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts and i know i'll be normal tomorrow but it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts.</div><div><br></div><div>Such cruel words..&nbsp;<br><br>People will always hurt each other..&nbsp; Trust no one trust no one &lt;3 Everything is bad and everyone is evil.

<div>I am 18 years old. I am currently suffering a psychotic break. I am emotional and I'm really tired of people..</div><div><br></div><div>I don't really want to trust people with my heart anymore. I don't really care how much I grovel or beg when I am not in my right mind- I was hurt by your actions. I was hurt by the things you said to me. To be quite frank, I find some of it to be unforgiveable. I find some of the conduct targeted towards me to be unforgiveable.</div><div><br></div><div>I have no desire to continue this further unless you apologize- unless you show some sympathy for my situation. I know you're hurting but I have been by your side for 3 years now. Now is truly not to time to isolate from me because I don't think I can forgive you.</div><div><br></div><div>I have cut you slack a lot, and I know I've been an awful friend in the past. You were there for me as I was there for you. I stuck through your many absences, I decided to view you fondly despite my reservations. It was a mistake. I'm tired of all of this. I'm tired of it all.&nbsp;<br><br>If you were scared of me killing myself, why would you ignore me when I talked about my psychosis? And maybe I sound cruel, but it's true.<br></div><div><br>I wanted you to take care of me. You don't really have the ability. You were cruel to me- both of you. Through your inaction and your words in the end. And then you asked me to leave when I was trying to fight my psychosis and switching for you. You violated my boundaries. You let me sit overstimulated. You left me alone as my psychosis got worse.</div><div><br></div><div>I shouldn't have relied on anyone to take care of me. We all know to take care of ourselves now, so well, I hope this is a listen I can keep close to me in the future and you know? You can excuse me of running.. But maybe I am leaving because it's hard to be with someone who runs away from me.</div><div><br></div><div>- Marie</div>

DATE: 10/08/2021 18:30:27

BODY:
<div>I want to talk about my feelings with this experience and with no anger or malice in my heart. I don't want to think about anyone else except for myself right now.</div><div><br></div><div>I sat outside in the cold for a while as a form of self harm. I planned to sleep out there until a dear friend online reminded me I have a plane tomorrow and having a cold on a plane would be very unpleasant. This made me go inside. Sometimes&nbsp; I need one logical argument rather than emotional ones. Emotion doesn't work very for me very well until a solid logical argument is presented.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I do a lot of silly things because of my mental illness. I spam my journals. I send long dms. I hurt myself. I overwhelm my friends. I make questionable decisions. I get weird delusions. I scare people. I run away. My feelings build inside my heart. The list is endless.</div><div><br></div><div>My coping mechanisms are bizarre but no one has the right to question them unless I am actively hurting myself or if they have a better solution- especially if some of my coping mechanisms are out of reach. It's a bit painful to feel like I'm bad for behaving a certain way such as when I detach from my emotions at the moment- especially when I have done this throughout my life to function as a person.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to be able to confront people when they hurt me. I am not there yet but eventually I will be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Despite being disabled, I don't want to rely on people. Many people hate to hangout with people who are on the schizophrenia spectrum because they can not deal with their bad days. I want to be able to deal with it on my own, unless I can find someone who I know for sure can deal with me when I am at my worse. I don't really think this will happen. It's a shame service dogs are a luxury.</div><div><br></div><div>I don't like to feel anger but I am mentally ill and human. When people do not work with me or when my logic fails, I get upset. I am very stubborn because I am logical and I feel as though my logic stumps over everything else. I am not broken for this. It's just how I am. Sometimes emotion can work for me when I am already emotional over a specific thing, but I simply prefer to be logical.</div><div><br></div><div>I have to sleep now. I'm tired. One more day and then I will see my sisters. Goodnight everyone.</div>
