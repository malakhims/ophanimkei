BODY:
<div>This one might be short too! We'll see. <br><br>I made a webring on neocities. It brings me much joy. I love my friends. I would do anything for them and being connected to them makes me very happy. The theme is RPG Maker... All of my friends like RPG Maker. There's 2 people I am not familiar with I kind of wantto convince to join but I won't bother.</div><div><br></div><div>I have a job interview at a home decor store tomorrow! Discount time haha.</div><div><br>Not going to lie, I want to kill myself.... College approaching.&nbsp; I have the money to go because of scholarships yet my disability continues to ruin my life.<br></div><div><br></div><div>My mom says I can't go to college if I'm not on antipsychotics. Lol, I should just slit my wrist. I can't.. I don't think my mom understands. It'd be nice to pay someone to beat me up I think... <br></div><div><br></div><div>I don't wanna be on meds. I am happy right now. It's not fair. I can't be on meds when they make me feel that way. She'll make me keep babysitting for shit pay while i'm horribly sick, I'll go to school and not be able t think clearly and drop out.</div><div><br>I should've taken the computer repair job. Haha.. Maybe I'll try to get my hands on heroin soon.<br></div>

BODY:
<div>Why would you give a psychotic person weed to calm them down, especially when you know you will refuse to take care of them to avoid killing your own vibe?</div><div><br></div><div>It hurts me a lot to think about. And me rejecting taking it sometimes.. I could see that it hurt you, but you refused to take care of me every time I spiraled afterwards or you'd put me in the bed.. I don't understand.</div><div><br></div><div>I kept warning you about how psychosis and weed interact, but you didn't take me seriously. You treated my psychosis like something I could control.. I don't understand why you'd do that.</div><div><br></div><div>At first I said I was happy I went there.. For the experience. But now it always hurts me. I wish it hadn't happened. I wish none of ithad happened.</div><div><br>I don't like the person that I am now and I don't like the experiences I've gone through.<br><br>What do I do? What do I do? <br></div><div><br></div><div>I liveblogged Pathologic to my friends today. It helped me a lot I think.. But of course sometimes it's hard to not think of you. Now I allow myself to and I find it's better than avoiding the topic entirely.</div><div><br></div><div>I worried about my dog passing away while I was gone. You didn't take me seriously. He passed away on Thursday. Remember when your cat passed away and you didn't talk to me for months. <br></div><div><br></div><div>I don't think you would've comforted me if my dog died while I was still there. You would've said you didn't have the energy. Maybe you'd try to get me high and I'd spiral.</div><div><br></div><div>The highs in our relationship were so high. I didn't think anything could match it. But the lows were so low. They were so low.</div><div><br></div><div>Even when I left, i spoke highly of you. I told people i hurt you... But they listened.. and listened... And they realized my perception was off. I was an unreliable narrator who'd been hurt by people who were not being very nice despite playing savior.</div><div><br></div><div>It all hurts so much. I just wish I was a little butterfly sometimes. <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>

BODY:
<div>Sometimes I try to talk to my mom openly and sincerely. It doesn't work very well. She eventually gets tired of dealing with my words and says I'm saying crap. I get really sad and angry and call myself worthless and wish she had a better daughter. We stop talking to one another.</div><div><br></div><div>It's just a wheel.. She says she's dealing with worse. I insult myself&nbsp; and verbalize what I think she thinks about me. I just.. We need to be in mother daughter therapy or something. Nothing will fix our relationship. I just don't wanna be here. I'm very close to just.. I don't know.</div><div><br></div><div>There's not much I can do but I do know I don't wanna deal with medication anymore. It is my end goal I think. I can't keep dealing with side effects. I don't have a say over what I put in my body at this point because she keeps threatening to not take me to college.. But she acts like medicine is the only option.&nbsp; I don't really know what to do about it.</div><div><br></div><div>I just don't want to do this anymore. I hate dealing with my doctor I hate dealing with my mother I hate medication I hate the psychiatric field. <br></div><div><br>I don't know how to talk to my mom when one of us will.</div><div><br></div><div>I think I should just shoot myself so that I don't have to be stuck in this endless cycle anymore. My mom thinks I'm too mentally ill to live without meds. Maybe she's right. But I don't think it's worth living on meds.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="https://malakhim.blog.fc2.com/img/yotsusorry.png/" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog-imgs-142.fc2.com/m/a/l/malakhim/yotsusorry.png" alt="yotsu sorry" style="width: 90px;"></a></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
