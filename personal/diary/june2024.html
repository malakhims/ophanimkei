    <img src="/images/emojis/cat.gif" height="90px" style="float:left;padding-right:10px;">what's up! i forgot to mention in any of my diary entries that i'd be going on a cruise during the final week of june. it was not my choice though i am grateful of course. hopefully this is the last cruise i experience in my life though. haha. being stuck in the middle of the ocean with no internet is not exactly my idea of fun, especially when most of the fun my family members in my age group were having consisted of drinking and night life. i'm a very boring person as you know (no partying, no drinking, no staying up late unless i'm doing art or suffering from insomnia). i got designated to watching my siblings after they fell asleep so my parents could go out and have fun since i would be asleep or playing tears of the kingdom. 
    <br><br>
    i did do things i enjoyed though... i liked to eat. i ate lots of good food. also, we had 3 we stopped at. the first one i did not enjoy. it was in the dominican republic. we just.. were at a pool. my cousin made a seat for me at the bar, but the pool water felt disgusting to me. i got out and got back on the cruise then worked on a website commission while i had internet. the next stop was in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I really loved it. colonialism sucked for the world but boy could Europeans design beautiful structures (though i'm struggling to identify who actually built san cristobal? was it slaves? was it spanish workers? who knows?)

    wait be right back i'm going to take a nap.

    <img src="/images/emojis/thumbsup.gif" height="50px" style="float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">hi everyone! i'm really sorry for the lack of updates. i had no time while i was in Japan, then i got back from Japan and immediately started working on Ommatophilia nonstop then i started my job which i'm doing all day. i'm going to try to finish it up this weekend. it's for the 'destination vacation' 32bitcafe code jam so..
    <br><br>
    i realize you're probably most excited to hear about my time abroad in japan which.. i should discuss... i miss the crab in osaka. it was really wonderful. lately while living, i feel constantly underwhelmed and bored all the time. in japan, i would just go walking in a random direction and find something to keep me entertained. i went to the junji ito art exhibition and it was really wonderful. i didn't research the exhibition much before going, so.. i didn't buy his new artbook that isn't available publicly yet. if i'd know it was only for sale there at the time, i would've gotten it.. 
    <br><br>
    i had really wonderful sushi,. the eel and crab dishes ai had were my favorite. the sushi was all really simple compared to the stuff in the united states. i struggle to call either better- though i only really went to affordable family sushi places. there's probably some really banging sushi in japan that would blow american sushi out of the water. the crab sushi i had in osaka was the best crab dish i've had in my entire life actually. it was at a sushi place in Kuramon Market. i went there on accident while looking for Kura ;w;
    <br><br>    
    aahh.. but this.. needs to be saved for the Japan page. you may be thinking.. how can we trust you to make the Japan page when you didn't even make the England page.. the difference is that I was blogging the entire time.. now i have all of these images sitting on my phone and things i'd like to say and advice i'd like to give. you get it?
    <br><br>
    ummm.... i guess i talk about my job. i started working at my mom's psychiatric office basically being a secretary assistant. the pay isn't good but the work is pretty easy, so i'm not upset or anything. i'm working full time so i'm making a good amount of money anyways. the job sucked at first because i was stuck in filing hell- standing all day organizing files, but today i was taught how to schedule patients and do some stuff on the computer. that's my jam. that's basically been every job i've had- front desk computer stuff. being customer facing is also pretty easy for me at this point even if it's exhausting. it's less exhausting than organizing files for 8 hours straight. my god.
    <br><br>
    there's not a lot of free time for me to do other things, but i'm hoping that will change once i get to sit down at a desk and just schedule patients and answer the phone. surely there will be moments of reprieve where i can get off on my computer. at least i'm hoping so.
    <br><br>
    oh other eventful things. today i met up with my biological dad and siblings. he told me he didn't like sushi and my dumbass took him to a restaurant that had mostly sushi. i had mixed it up with another asian fusion place. luckily, he liked hibachi so it was fine. we had fun conversations. i talked a lot about my japan trip. you know i'm wondering if i should try talking about my japan trip with text to speech instead of typing out everything. maybe that's why i've been working on the page so slowly. it's super easy to have a conversation about. i wish someone could just interview me. or maybe there's a big traveler's blog questionnaire. 
    <br>
    <sub>quick google search</sub>
    <br>
    I couldn't find a long questionnaire but I found some. Maybe I can compile them together or something.. But.. reading me answering a bunch of questions would probably be boring.. I'll finish my essay.. yes. I'll just try the text to speech thing!
    <br><br>
    I feel as though this wasn't very eventful.. i've struggled to write diary entries lately....... i just want to talk about dresses i'm interested in. which i will do. now.

    I don't really care about Chobits, but this collab is really beautiful to me. I don't think I'm going to buy it though because a leather dress sounds like it will be a sweat factory. It also just doesn't seem like it suits any season. But, woof, if it hasn't taken over my mind. I might give in and buy it anyways.

    I can't spend much at the moment as I need to invest in new Mary Janes. I went to Dillards (mistake) and saw gianni bini mary janes that were the cutest shape ever. they're just pretty expensive because they're brand name. i don't know anything about gianni bini but my mom was like "that's a brand that's why it's pricy." fortunately, job.
    <br><br>
    I have some things i Need to ship this Friday though.. so i need to be careful with how much money i spend.. i'm hanging out with Maistress this Friday so hopefully i can say.. 'hi.. can we stop by post office..' and she will understand the Shipping Fever i am in. I should divide everything out now.. so much to ship ;-w-.
    <br><br>
    well, it's 3:21AM. i only wrote this because i could not sleep. i will make an attempt now. nini.
