       <img src="/images/emojis/hello.webp" height="150px" style="float:left;"> it's new years eve! much to think about. i read last year's entry and it was rather sour. i have many sour things i could talk about but to be quite frank, i am feeling very lazy. i wanted to make new year's art and a new year's page because it's my favorite holiday, but now it is the 31st and i doubt i will get the energy to do all i wanted.
       <br><br>
       I didn't do much of what I intended during winter break, but school left me quite exhausted. I got good grades (huzzah), did well on my JP final. I did manage to release the next part of my game to beta testers which is very nice. However, since then I have not been able to convince myself to work on it. I'm very tired lol. I also got off schedule on my meds making me even more tired. And my mom keeps making me babysit when I am awake making me even more tired. やれやれだぜ.
       <br><br>
       It's time to talk about resolutions. Last year my resolution was something along the time of stop wasting time on people who do not give me much time. Did I do this? Hm... Mostly. I screwed up with one person this year, and they burned me and my friends pretty bad on an important thing. I just really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm happy that I stuck to my principles and kept giving them chances, but I wish I hadn't been so foolish and let their attitude affect the people around me. Sigh. 
       <br><br>
       This year I haven't been giving people much time at all haha! I've been a bit too disconnected.. Not responding to messages and focusing on work. Not hanging out very much. Whoopsies. I definitely prefer this over begging for people's attention though!
       <br><br>
       Anyway, it's time to make resolutions for next year. Let us begin.
       <br><br>
       <b>Resolution Time</b>
       <br><br>
       <ol>
        <li>I'd like to finish at least 75% of Ommatophilia! I actually think I'll get much farther, but I don't want to aim for the moon.</li>
        <li>Study way more. I was able to save myself studying last minute for Japanese last year, but it could've gone badly. I must study consistently</li>
        <li>Check my school email more. Self explanatory.</li>
        <li>Enter at least one game jam</li>
        <li>Spend more carefully</li>
       </ol>

       <b>Lolita Goals</b>
       <ol>
         <li>I'd like to buy more dramatic/memorable/diverse pieces rather than sticking to bxw. Maybe I'll invest in customs from glittertale every once in a while.</li>
         <li>Invest in white shoes</li>
         <li>Save more coords and streetsnaps to my hard drive x_x I lose things so often</li>
      </ol>

      That's all! You might've noticed.. No website related goals! Well. Yeah. To be honest, I've been trying to tone down things on my website and just remember it's a fun side hobby. Like, I didn't feel pressure to make the New Year's page. I haven't been updating my new pages as often. I'm vibing. 
      <br><br>
      In June, ophanimkei will reach its 4th year of existence, and I've been updating consistently all this time. It's been so fun! and I want to keep it fun by not expecting myself to do a lot of things for it cx. Hopefully, that's understandable. Of course, I still hope to make new pages and do new things if I have time!
      <br><br>
      I hope you have a Happy New Year. See you in 2024.

       <img src="/images/emojis/konata.gif" style="float:left;"> Hi everyone!!!! Tomorrow morning I have my JP exam and need to finish up most of my online exams for my classes. I would've done it today, but I've been working since 12pm... I fell asleep earlier than I intended so didn't study as much as I wanted to. I'm burning out pretty fast but just a few more days and I'll make it.
       <br><br>
       Also, I noticed I haven't been documenting my lolita coords lately.. I used to wonder why people didn't document their coords but now I'm one of them! It's pretty tiring. I'm just lazy. I want to get dressed and leave.. I'm considering deactivating my Instagram because I just don't really see the point of posting pictures, but I feel like it's nice to document my life somewhere so I can look at how I'm progressing and the fun I've been having. I always get this itch to delete my IG after a while. Then I do it and kind of regret it lol.
       <br><br>
        I got accepted into a lolita zine which makes me happy.. I have a lot of art I need to make during winter break. And a big website commission.  Woof woof. I'm just so tired. 4 more days of 24 hour coverage then I'm free and can go home. It doesn't sound like a lot when I write it that way.
        <br><br>
        I had an oral interview in JP recently and did really well, thank god. Now I just need to pass this exam. Unfortunately I didn't study as much as I would've liked, but I don't think I'll fail. I just have to.. work really hard yes. I looked over the study guide tonight and it all makes sense. I also now understand what arimasu is used for which is really important for the exam tomorrow. I would've liked to look over it more with my friend Citrus, but unfortunately my time management skills leave much to be desired.
        <br><br>
        Anyway, last thing, I'm considering getting rid of a lot of my clothes. I kind of just want to become a jfashion girly and avoid fast fashion as much as possible. I got a lot of Japanese branded stuff in the mail recently and it made me really happy. I just worry if I get rid of my fast fashion stuff, I won't have much to wear when I go home because I tend to dress a bit more safely around family rather than wearing lolita or other 90s jfashion inspired stuff. My friend suggested I get a large like trunk and just put a lot of my clothes in there. Which is appealing but there's nowhere to put a trunk in my room beccause there's so many suitcases in here. AAAA.
        <br><br>
        Anyway, I'm only awake because I got a call. RA moments. I'd like to back to sleep... so I will try to do that now...
