    <img src="/images/emojis/miku.gif" height="100px" style="float:left;">hi everypony. i've had an eventful past week or two since the last update. i went to sakura festival and performed soran bushi. i didn't do the best job but i did have fun which is what matters i think.
    <br><br>
    I hungout with the lolitas on that side of the state which was a good time.  I went to a market and bought some tea tree soap and african black soap. based. we got some really yummy pizza at some restaurant. i got that pierrot miku prize figure. it's my first miku figure. she's. huge. i didn't know sega figures were so big. i can't imagine the size of a scale.
    <br><br>
    I've been working on a page for my England pictures, but I've been moving very slowly. I hope to finish it up this weekend. I'm just so tired. I wanted to do a lot today, but I couldn't get out of bed. It's 2AM now. Despite sleeping all day, I still feel like garbage. I think I need to eat more vegetables and proteins. I got a bit too focused on starches. And starches are just so filling- I'd barely eat anything then immediately feel full.
    <br><br>
    Anyway, I've honestly been trying to write this entry for a while now, but I've had nothing to say. Despite my exciting time at the sakura festival and exploring the city, i haven't felt excited to talk about it. i think i'm burned out or something. just want to stay in bed all the time. worried i won't be alive for my Japan trip, but.. it should be fine. i hope. i'll eat healthy food and walk lots hopefully... and drink tea.. yes.
    <br><br>
    I heard about a job for next semester and got in contact with the guy offering it. So, hopefully that works out. If I can work more than 9 hours a week, that would be ideal so I can build my savings while also buying lolita. 9 hours a week is not cutting it ;-w-.
    <br><br>
    anyway, i picked omma dev back up.. into the meat of things. feeling good but also so exhausted i can't get much done. i got past one part i've been dreading a bit. i may add more to it later, but for now, it is sufficient. i'm feeling really good about omma! it'll be good.. just.. need to pick up the pace in the summer.
    <br><br>
    well.
    <br><br>
    i guess i have nothing else to say.. i feel like i usually am more energetic with my entries but i'm just so tired. i've had nothing to say.... sorry my head is so empty.

    <img src="/images/emojis/dizzygirl.gif" height="95px" style="float:left;padding:10px;"> Study abroad to Japan has been funded! woo!! woo!! I know in last entry I said it wasn't, but it worked out. I've also been trying to recover from the depression hell I've been in. Going to class, talking to people. 
    <br><br>
    Tonight I am on call. Anyway, we have these little meetings where we try to get residents to join us to do fun things. It always falls on the day I'm on call which is nice because I get to get out of the office. Today was a painting day.  I ended up talking to another RA and an ex RA for quite some time. It was so nice. They came to my room to see the view, I playedmusic on my aurora speaker and the purple lights glowed on the ceiling, we talked about dating and made plans to go to a vintage store next Friday. I said they could go without me, but one insisted I come. I'm just so happy. I don't know. I just. They said we're friends... I'm just so happy. I've felt pretty distant from the other RAs, but this just.. makes me ectastic.
    <br><br>
    They invited me over to hangout, but I needed to do homework, so I declined. I went to the dining hall and saw an old friend and talked to her for way longer than I shoud have. Like an hour and thirty minutes. I was so excited during the conversation. I felt a bit guilty telling her about all my interests and what I was doing, but she loved it. We talked about movies. I showed her the trailer for Paprika. We talked about  horror movies. She told me there's a sequel for The Shining that's really good. Ah. I'm happy. I had good social interaction today.
    <br><br>
    I got distracted and started saving lots of crunchy anime gifs.. Now it's 1:05AM. Whoops.
    <br><br>
    I've got to talk to multiple professors about me completely checking out mentally during the semester. Please wish me luck. I'm scared. I'm so scared. I'm worried baout my grades and thinking about it has made my stomach hurt LAWL. It's 1:24AM now I started looking at more 100x100 gifs. I'm clown. Whopps.
    <br><br>
    Anyway..
    <br><br>
    JAPAN!!! IN A MONTH AND 9 DAYS!!! WOOPEEE!!! Okay I take anxiety meds and sleep.
