TITLE: one more week

BODY:
Dread…<br/><br/>My family got together for the 4th. This will be my last time seeing them all together before I go to college. I'm nauseated. My granny gave me a box of lotions and i almost started to cry.<br/><br/>It's been a day since I wrote that last paragraph. I'm watching Stranger Things for the first time. The vibes are good. It makes me want to create. <br/><br/>I'm feeling anxious like I'll collapse.. College is too close. I'm.. not feeling good. I get flashbacks to last year when I think about leaving. <br/><br/>I have to rest… Stranger things is interesting…. i wish I had something good to eat

BODY:
i'm actually pretty happy :-)<br/><br/>my family came together before i left and talked to me. they gave me some things, like a bonnet for my braids, pajamas, underwear, a backpack. The backpack is a color I dislike, but I'm going to try to cover it in pins over time anyways.<br/><br/>My family stopped for a vacation in the mountains and even though we didn't do anything today because of the length of the car ride, I had a lot of fun. We laughed and talked lots. My cousin and I played pool and air hockey (both of which i was very bad at) and connect 4 (which i was good at) while listening to 2000s emo music.<br/><br/>I left a lot of jewelry at home and i was sad, but I have some chains, my fishnet top, my fishnets, belts, my striped sleeves, so I can still look cool my first day of school. My mom says she'll mail me my jewelry.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sleepy now, so I will head to bed, but today was good. I'm looking forward to the future even if i am afraid.

BODY:
I read My Heart is a Chainsaw. It was a good read, pretty long. I even read the acknowledgments!! I felt like a child as I read, sinking into the narrative and losing track of my surroundings. My cousin called my name because I didn't notice the car had stopped, and we were at our destination. I didn't want to stop reading as we walked through the streets looking at tourist sites. Writing is so powerful. <br><br><br/><br/>I added it to my Goodreads, which I made a few weeks ago. It's nice to know I'm reading books again. Not sure what I'll read next. I got this book from a google drive, but I found Library Genesis recently. I'm going to grab some Fear Street books and read them I think. <br><br><br/><br/>Onto other things, we went on an earthquake fake subway ride and it was funny. We went through this little tunnel and there was a gorilla and some alligators. My cousin and I had no idea what was going on. <br><br><br/><br/>A bee chased her as we walked back to the car because she was wearing yellow which made me laugh. Next to our truck was a Nightmare Before Christmas themed car. <br><br><br/><br/>I also went to a jewelry shop and bought too many things. I accidentally left all my jewelry at home, so I was trying to make up for it. I bought 4 black mood rings, a leather bracelet (which I thought was a choker, and some earrings. I spent $40 like a clown. <br><br><br/><br/>We're heading… somewhere now? Not sure where. <br><br><br/><br/>Today will be my last day hanging out with my family before college tomorrow, so I need to relish all of this fun time. I slept for a while heading up the though.. Whoops…<br><br><br/><br/>The mountain was really fun! I forgot to mention. We drove to the top rather than hiked because it was raining today. I've got pictures! <br><br><br/><br/><br/><center><br/><a href="https://malakhim.blog.fc2.com/img/20220713172158.webp/" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog-imgs-150.fc2.com/m/a/l/malakhim/20220713172158s.webp" style="max-width:40%"></a><br><br><br/><br/><a href="https://malakhim.blog.fc2.com/img/20220713172158_20220714062216.png/" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog-imgs-150.fc2.com/m/a/l/malakhim/20220713172158_20220714062216s.png" style="max-width:40%"></a><br/></center><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

TITLE: It’s My Special Day


DATE: 07/25/2022 23:13:19
BODY:
<div>It’s my birthday!</div><div><br></div><div>I haven’t updated in a while. I’ve been so busy. But, I’m 19! Isn’t that wild. Next year I’m 20, which is terrible.</div><div><br></div><div>I am hoping for a good year. At this moment I am in my summer class. I am kind of bored because we are talking about academic integrity which my high school was obsessed with. I’ve heard a lot of this before.</div><div><br></div><div>I am officially a Computing student (with a concentration in computer science!) Isn’t that exciting? I’m afraid of the math, but I am looking forward to it. It’s time to spend a horrendous amount of time studying.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, lots of things have happened. My mom took my favorite cardigan and said she’d burn it because it had a pentagram on it. I now don’t have a cardigan or jacket for school. I’ve been wearing the same hoodie everyday. I’m hoping someone sends me money so that I can buy a new cardigan- this time solid black.</div><div><br></div><div>I’m not sure I’ll get anything though. For my birthday we went to the mountains which was really fun and also my big gift.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<a href="https://malakhim.blog.fc2.com/img/C4F9282C-3754-4B4C-9E7D-127EEDDB5913-min.webp/" target="_blank" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><img src="https://blog-imgs-150.fc2.com/m/a/l/malakhim/C4F9282C-3754-4B4C-9E7D-127EEDDB5913-min.png" alt="C4F9282C-3754-4B4C-9E7D-127EEDDB5913-min.webp" style="width: 200px;"></a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">My college is in a place like this. Isn’t it beautiful? I went hiking the other day with some students and it was delightful. It hurt my legs a lot, but it was worth it.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">I’ve walked across the campus several times; it now feels tiny to me. I feel somewhat trapped again, but that’s okay. I think there’s a bus system, so I’ll be able to go places in fall when I learn how the bus system works.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">I have to get back to work now. Sayooonaraaaa</div>

BODY:
<div>I am in class. We aren’t talking about anything particularly interesting which is why I am currently typing this. Lunch is in an hour, but I’m not really hungry. I ate a big breakfast and drank chamomile tea.</div><div><br></div><div>I had a little breakdown last night, but I’m feel kind of normal now!!</div><div><br></div><div>I got more excited about my major today even though it also stresses me out. Computers!!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Did I ever mention I got my class schedule? I don’t have it on me right now- just know I am taking pre-cal. AM I READY??? Dun duun duuuun. I have to take a lot of math and I am very excited and afraid.</div><div><br></div><div>Excited because I want to understand more. Afraid because I am not the best at math. I have to take up to cal II. Waahahahaa. I want to understand everything in the world but also I’m going to cryyy. I’m so excited!!!</div><div><br></div><div>I’m stressed and excited and sick and stressed and excited!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I’m happy.. I’m finally not trapped in a house. I’m not stuck playing video games in my bed. I’m not working at a grocery store. I’m so happy.</div>
