    <p style="text-align:left;">Hello everynyan. Welcome to the yaoi <s>dungeon</s> haven. My media page has been rather barren recently because I have been reading so much yaoi. I unfortunately can't go around sharing my thoughts on yaoi I read due to most of it having questionable content, but I was a bit too anxious to really talk about it anywhere on my website.
    <br><br>
    However, inspired by Hatsune Miku (well specifically the producer SAWTONE), I've created this page. I thought isolating it here was ideal and going throguh some measures to keep all adult content in a specific corner that isn't easily accessible and won't appear on the neocities feed.
    <br><br>
    <b>Disclaimer.</b> 
    <br><br>
    I read a lot of really weird yaoi, and this page is 18+ as evidenced by the miku that is on the front page of this section of the website. But like, you know how everyone makes fun of dark romance girls. I'M ONE OF THEM. WOE IS ME. I can't confidently make fun of women reading about weird men in their YA fiction because I read Yakuza yaoi you understand? I read a lot of yaoi that isn't ~good~ plot wise, but it keeps me entertained.
    <br><br>
    it's my silly media. you understand. you understand. also i talk about porn here. no minors allowed. though i'm not stupid and recognize not all minors will listen. if you don't listen, don't ENGAGE WITH ME. don't TALK TO ME. stay AWAY FROM ME.
