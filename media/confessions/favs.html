The story/setting is clever excuse for the author to draw everyone in kink gear. To be honest, this is one of my favorites because I just really like the variety of kink gear, and the linework is so beautiful. Some of the dynamics are super interesting, and there is a wide variety of them. I am easy to please.

This is good for good reason. It's a very predictable story, but it's satisfying to watch it play out. To be honest, I enjoy the side couple more than the main couple, and their chapters were always fun to read to me. Though I didn't like the last one at the end of the webtoon. It actually kind of confused me and felt a bit out of character for Chan-Woo, but it didn't ruin my enjoyment of BJ Alex or anything.

It's about a guy who gets cursed by someone(???) and is turned into a girl randomly, and then.. you see title. It's actually a very interesting work despite the title just being generic hentai material haha. It has some interesting things to say about gender, realizing you're gay, being in a gay relationship, etc etc. It's also very silly and funny. The last chapters are kind of cringe though haha.

        Kill the Lights is a webtoon I really enjoyed that is apparently based on a novel that is way better, so perhaps in due time this webtoon cover will be replaced with the novel cover. Kill the Lights is about a celebrity who dies and the soul of a mercenary ends up in his body. There's a lot of stuff happening in this manga- I don't know how to keep summarizing it, but it was interesting, and I enjoyed it. I liked Mason a lot. Mason is actually the reason I think this is one of my favorites. He is such a character, and I enjoy when both people in the relationship match each other's energy (and the romantic interest is a fucking character)

I just enjoy moe business men. The illustrations are cute. Moe business men. Moe business men. Moe business men. To be honest I have a hard time putting into words why this is one of my favorites other than moe business men. There's not a lot going on. Otsu is kind of a piece of work at times, but he is often compared to a grumpy cat. Minegishi is very cute.

I'm sorry. Is it weird to put this in my favorites? I just really liked it lol. I sometimes think about it randomly. There's a lot of crazy shit in this. I'd love to look into the author's mind and also their bookmarks. It's a harem yaoi. Would you believe I don't think I've ever actually consumed harem anything. I find the concept appealing, but most executions rather boring. But this really fucking entertains me. It made me laugh a lot. I'd just be sitting in the dark and then I'd burst out laughing. And sometimes, I'd have to cover my face because I felt embarrassed about what was happening in the story. Also, despite their being a trope I usually hate in these stories, I actually really love that chapter in this one webtoon!! I'd kill to see what else this artist is making!!
