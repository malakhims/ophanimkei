        I really like this manwha and makes my suffering worth it. Thank you, <str><i>checks author name</i></str> Majeungji!!!  It was a random surprise. I kind of go through these yandere reading lists expecting to feel nothing at the end of most stories. It is the equivalent of reading poor fanfiction as a teenager for no reason in particular.. It's just now I am an adult and I have to filter out omegaverse. ANYWAY.
        <br><br>
        Love Plan was very bizarre, but I loved it.. I love.. you Siyeon (the ML). You are so cute and so desperate and so so deranged. Siyeon never actually harms his love interest, Jaewoo. I can't go into specifics. He does manipulate him haha, but it's just kind of.. You must read it. Saeyoo has problems that I love. I wish this manga was longer. I'd love to explore the intricacies of these two further. Make that boy suffer!!! And then.. Grow from it. LOL. I think it'd be super fun with Siyeon and Jaewoo specifically because Siyeon's character flaws all feel very redeemable and manageable,and Jaewoo seems to have a good understanding of Siyeon.. We never get manga like this for 70+ chapters T_T.

            This manwha's fucked up and don't read it if you don't like fucked up manwha. I sometimes go through the yandere lists on bato, and this one.. Kinda bad. I don't know. I was so curious about where the cult stuff would go (it went nowhere). We don't even get a clear idea of Noah's goals or beliefs by the end of the manwha which is so lame. Why have homosexual priests if you're not going to explore their religion? Why did those characters do any of that? Why did they sexually assault Agotho? What did that have to do with their ritual? Why were they willing to use him as sacrifice? I don't know. I know like you're probably thinking "what the hell why does this matter?" IT MATTERS TO TRUE RELIGIOUSLY TRAUMATIZED HOMOSEXUALS OKAY..
            <br><br>
            Agotho is boring- he's tortured just for being good. Noah is so evil without purpose that it's boring. The random priest who you forget about then who reappears at the end of the story is boring and also so stupid. DUMBASS! F!!!!!!! Though I like Noah's design he could be an RPG Maker villain lol. But yeah I have more reasons for not like this manwha but exploring will just piss me off lmao. It's deeper than what I've gone into but the amount of effort to explain why I dislike this yaoi will take more effort than the author put into the plot lmao.

    Jinx is like the most popular yaoi at the moment based on every single site I go on.. The manwha actually makes me mad haha. To be honest I have no idea why I continue reading Jinx. I don't like the ML. The protagonist is... not the kind of protagonist I enjoy. It's not even a dynamic I like. I just feel kind.. I guess it's like watching those drama shows where everyone hates each other, but you want to see how it ends. Like, I'm not really interested in the romance or the characters, but I am invested in how she's going to make the ML NOT AN ASSHOLE. This manwhaga(?) did it well in BJ Alex, but I felt Alex was.. not nearly as irredeemable as Jae-kyung. Though.. I do think there are some aspects about Jae-Kyung that are respectable but it's just like things I don't care about LMAO.
    <br><br>
    Like, Dan Kim, the protag.. being the way that he is actually might be reason I am invested. Season 2 is interesting to me specifically because of Dan Kim. I just wish that he.. wasn't.. so baby. LOL. I don't know. Jinx will never be one of my favorites, and there's a chance I'll hate it by the end but I'm too invested to stop- especially since the dynamic from the first season is FINALLY OVER. I just want to see Jae-kyung bark like a dog. I also.. like watching Jae-kyung interact with Kim Dan's grandmother. I like Kim's Dan's grandmother as a character in general. I feel like they are the most interesting dynamic in the series though we don't get too much of them.

    UUGHHH. tired of these horse faced assholes.

        <a href="https://anilist.co/manga/132120/Full-Volume/"><img src="https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/medium/b132120-6Pbp0epS96VX.png" style="float:left;"></a> 
        <p>
        Full Volume was fun and also distressing at times. Not like black flag or dark romance kind of distressing, but there's a specific plot point revolving one of the characters' that is explored and I found myself skimming through these chapters because they really stressed me out. But I think the topic is explored well- it's regarding sexual exploitation.
        <br><br>
        I really liked Full Volume. I actually started it earlier at some point, but lost interest only to pick it back up because I was so fucking bored. The story kinda goes about lacksadaisically, but this is something I enjoy. The first chapters just kinda annoyed me at first haha.One thing I like about the manwha is that the threats in the plots never really feel like true threats- you know the ML and protagonist will be fine despite the fact that they're both stressed the fuck out. For me, the true joy is seeing how they take care of each other and get through these situations together and how they can suddenly make a horrible memory very positive. In the words of Do-Won, I love premarital sex!
        <br><br>
        Also, the side stories are really fantastic. They're my favorite part of the webtoon. It touches on gang-stuff which is fun for me and I like the dynamic between the side couple and how they interact with the main couple too. It's so fucking funny actually I'm giggling thinking about it. Also, the sex scenes in the entire webtoojn (aside from a few which are meant to be uncomfortable) are really fun. The author's notes were fun too... Something something too many twinky bottoms we need beefy bottom.. I prefer when people in relationships in yaoi tend to be equal to each other in stature (I don't know why lmao) so I support you beefy yaoi fans!

     <p> I've been in the yuri and yaoi dungeons. I made this page then magically ran out of content lmao. But I can talk about things I'm currently reading even if I'm not in a hurry to finish them. We'll start with Painter of the Night since it's apparently a classic (among manwhas). I did not know this because despite this yaoi page existing, I don't know much about yaoi history/popularity haha. To be honest, I don't know how to feel about Painter of the Night. I've gotten to a point in the work where the love interest.. is.. doing something. LOL. I don't know. He's been a menace most of the manga, but he's very beautiful. Seung-Ho a very beautiful character <str>I like to imagine he is a woman</str>. It's fun to watch him crash out, and he looks beautiful while doing it.
     <br><br>
     It's just.. hmm.. he sucks really bad lol. There's usually some kind of redeeming quality I can think of for these "bad" type of love interests in these works, but his only one is that he is unintentionally funny when he is cruel. He acts so flippantly and arrogantly, and also, a lot of the other characters in the work are assholes, so when he's being an asshole to an asshole, it's great.
     <br><br>
     The protagonist, Na-Kyum, is fine. He is like.. the picture boy of the young yaoi boy who is manipulated into a relationship and then constantly tormented by various people for things out of his control. I wish he was a bit more interesting, but if anything it feels like the story wants to establish how uninteresting he is. And I enjoy a boring protagonist sometimes but it basically means every single thing he does is because of someone else's manipulation. It bores me a bit. It's why I put it on hold at Chapter 75 actually. I was just losing interest.. My only motivation to keep reading is to find out why Seung-Ho is so fucked and how he's going to enact punishment on those who have wronged him and Na-Kyum. Hopefully I come back with my thoughts on this.. eventually.
