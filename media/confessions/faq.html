    <p style="text-align:left;">Here are questions people tend to wonder about me once I reveal I am into yaoi since it's not something people tend to guess about me.
        <br><br>
        <b>1. You're a lesbian. Why do you read yaoi if you're a lesbian?</b><br>
        To be honest, I'm not completely sure LOL. I do prefer yuri and I read straight stuff occasionally. I think I just find the diversity and weirdness of the yaoi genre really interesting. I find a lot of romance stories really boring, but yaoi often entertains me. Things that are revolutionary in the yuri genre are often common in the yaoi genre. Also, it's primarily written by women which I like a lot haha though I read bara occasionally too but it's usually random oneshots I see around... Hm also, I realized I find yaoi almost sexless in a way. Men are so seperate from me since I'm not attracted to them, and they generally have very little to do with me. Yaoi men also don't even look like real people to me to be honest. Something about that appeals to me a lot. 
        <br><br>
        <b>2. Do you consider yourself a fujoshi?</b>
        My friends call me a fujoshi and send me fujoshi memes, and I appreciate memes aimed at fujoshis, but well, I don't really know HAHA! The people who identify as fujoshi in the west seem way more into yaoi as a concept than I am though in Japan it seems like people there would call me a fujoshi. I like some MLM doujinshi and the like though I've never collected any of it or been public about my interests (until now) because I'm not in fandom haha.
        <br><br>
        <b>3. How do you feel about *insert discourse here?*</b><br>
        I'm old, and I don't really use social media that much.
        <br><br>
        <b>4. What mediums do you like?</b>
        <br> I primarily consume manga and Korean webtoons, however, I've slowly been getting into doujinshi and random fan artists for things I like but it's difficult for me. Canon is sometimes sacrosanct to my brain so doujinshi for things I like can be hard to consume, especially since I'm not really attracted to men in media I read.. So I don't have reason to seek it out until my brain is peaked by the idea of them being in a situation.
        <br><br>
        <b>5. What are tropes you enjoy?</b>
        <br>I want the two characters to be able to have tension/balance between each other rather than having one character completely overpower/dominate the other. It bores me then. This can be done emotionally or through both characters' feeling confident in combat abilities. Yakuza stories often meet a soft spot for me if they aren't boring. I also like when the couple usually are similar to each other proportionally.. It's not like a requirement though. I wouldn't be able to read a lot of things if that were the case! I also think I'm more comfortable with these stories because I know they won't be as poorly drawn haha.. Sometimes people say the art in a webtoon is nice but the proportions of the ML are so weird that I can't.. look at it. HAHA. Yaoi hands are tolerable but when his torso is the size of the entire protag.. It's.. bizarre.. Perhaps I just know too much about muscles and bone structure..
        <br><br>
        <b>6. What the fuck? I thought you were a yuri sister?</b>
        <br> I can have multiple interests!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yuri is my life and it will always be above yaoi for me!! The himejoshi doctrine must not be abandoned.. However... Do you hear that? The wind is so loud...
