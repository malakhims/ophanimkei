                Hello everyone!! Welcome to my tunes page! I wanted to make this because music is such an important part of my life, and I felt like I needed a part of my site dedicated to it!!
                <br><br>
                I'm not like a super cool music person or anything.. I try to be.. but I listen to music on $5 earbuds I bought in Japan and tend to listen to the same things over and over again. I play guitar but I'm pretty bad LOL. I think I'd be better if I could play by ear, but I can't so I struggle to learn songs I really want to play you know? (Speaking of if you're good at making guitar tabs just from listening to songs, hit me up!) Punk rock and punk pop is pretty easy though at least! Up until the guitar solos.
                <br><br>
                Still, I'm hoping to slowly add things here over time. My music listening ability has been somewhat nerfed recently as I randomly get migraines. I actually can't listen to Cocteau Twins at all anymore because their music just makes my ears bleed, but I still try to listen to hardcore stuff and loud ass vocaloid until I can't anymore lol. 
                <br><br>
                Indie folk and sovietwave are my favorite genres so it doesn't pose too much of an issue in my daily listening, and even when I'm in the mood to listen to Machine Girl or old My Chemical Romance, I still can for a while- just not all day.
                <br><br>
                I also like vocaloid, but I am a casual listener. The vocaloids themselves interest me less than the artists though I do like them a lot. As a kid, my favorite vocaloid was Oliver, but now I'm old and basic and I simply fall into the Miku fan factory line. My favorite musician is Pinocchio-P though I love Utata-P's Happiness Series more than anything in the world. It's not on my lastfm because Utata-P doesn't really upload their music on streaming services, but those songs mean a lot to me. Utata-P would probably be my favorite musician if his stuff was a bit more accessible lol.
                <br><br>
                I will surely make a Happiness Series shrine in the future. Consider this a sneak peak. See you later!
