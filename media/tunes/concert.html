                Hello! So a few weeks ago I went to a Machine Girl concert. It was the first concert I've been to since I was in middle school, and the concert I went to in middle school was like.. it was kind of like a stadium. There were chairs. I stood up the entire time because I am short and the guy front of me was standing and the girl next to me.. We tried to out dance each other. It was fun.
                
                <br><br>

                But this was.. insane. Actually. You must understand I never go out anywhere. Being in the crowd and being that close to the musicians was so awesome. The closest experience I've had to something like this was an underground club in Japan, but that atmosphere was much more chill despite some of the intense music that played.
                
                <br><br>

                First I will discuss the opening acts briefly. They were really good! I didn't get a lot of clips of them, but I loved them both. It was <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kill+Alters">Kill Alters</a> and <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sn%C3%B5%C3%B5per">Snooper</a>- both were fantastic and I added them to my listening rotation.

                <br><br>

                I mainly want to discuss the bug. The Bug. 

                <br><br>

                So Snooper has this bug mascot. It's a giant bug. Okay? Okay. It walks through the crowd and dances, but it doesn't go through the moshers. It goes through the back of the crowd. The problem is the that venue wasn't super huge, and the radius of the moshers kept increasing, but people weren't moshing (me at the time) still wanted to be close, so we were packed pretty tightly.
                <br><br>

                </center>
                The mascot is walking and dancing and COMING IN MY DIRECTION!!!!!! And I couldn't move because were tightly packed. I could just enough to dance and that was it. So. This bug, it's determined.
                <br><br>
                Right after I end this video, I look up and it's right in front of me, and I'm like "It wants to walk this way... I see.." I try to move out the way. I push myself back into the crowd. I'm basically leaning into them in a c shape, barely standing as this bug walks through me. I'm squished between them and the Snooper mascot. I understand the feeling of every beetle that's gone under my foot that didn't die on impact.
                <br><br>
                So it's too tight right in front of me. The snooper mascot gives up on going through the crowd and turns around and leaves. I stand there, dumbstruck like, "Oh. i guess i'll just remember forever now" LOL. It was really fucking funny. I wonder what the people behind were thinking. Note: I was in lolita. I was dressed in a full gothic lolita nun coord LOL.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, this is my note on the opening acts. You should totally listen to them by the way. I'm listen to Snooper while writing this, and I'm chilling. I kind of hope they find this entry and know that a gothic lolita was crushed by their bug lol. It was really funny though guys we're chill.
                <br><br>
                I wish could say more Kill Alters other than they were good, but that's all I can say about Snooper and Kill Alters. They were very good. I wish I bought their merch. I hope to see them perform again. Gotta headout West.
                <br><br>
                Now let's move on to the Machine Girl highlights.
                <br><br>
                So notable things that occured during the Machine Girl concert. Every time they were visible just off stage, the crowd would cheer. This was funny as fuck. Also, Matt, the lead, he's built as fuck. This will be relevant.
                <br><br>
                So, note, I attended this concert with my friend Kyou so when the concert started, I managed to get back next to Kyou but people started the flooding the main floor like pack rats and skittering around, so I had to move to actually be able to see Matt.
                <br><br>
                They played basically everything I wanted to hear. They even played something from RePurpoised Phantasies which I didn't expect. RePurphoised Phantasies is one of my favorite EPs by them, and I mentioned in passing and basically someone started to explain to me that Machine Girl will probably just play hardcore stuff at their show. I didn't really care if they played it or not because I like everything by Machine Girl- no exaggeration, but they did and it made me really happy. I was fucking chilling. (They also played Motherfather which is my favorite recent release by them).
                <br><br>
                Anyway, Matt runs off stage.
                <br><br>

                    <b>MATT RUNS OFF STAGE</b>

                <br><br>
                So Matt ran off stage and into the audience. I think at first  he might've been <a href="">crowd surfing then fell down and crushed someone LOL.</a> He's built as fuck he's very heavy. But, he starts singing going out of the crowd. I lose sight of him. At first I consider trying to approach him, but the moshers are following him. I've been absorbed by the moshers a few times throughout the concert. It's fun for a bit, but not like, peak to me. When you're built like a twig, that shit is kind of scary actually. I'll say I was moshing for a while, but then I guy who had a BMI of over 35 appeared in front of me, and I decided that I needed to stop moshing for the night.
                <br><br>
                Okay, back to Matt. He gets on top of some thing and performs on something. I don't know what that thing is lol.

                He's over there and I'm thinking "hm, he's gone around a lot of the crowd. Surely, he'll come over here." I am a bit anxious about this because I'm afraid of being absorbed by the moshers admittedly, but he does come over here, and the moshers I think they're held back by our tightly packed nonmosher barrier lol. <br><br>
                He comes over here. He's right around me and Kyou and other people. He gets into a staring contest with a random guy. Apparently I caught the entire on video and took pictures of the aftermath. Enjoy.

                <b>he's fucking dead</b>
                </center>
                <sub>apologies, i must be honest. i didn't come up with the "he's fucking dead" line. someone shouted it in the crowd and it's been on my mind ever sense.</sub>
                <br><br>
                i think about trying to help him up, but he's built as fuck. he does get helped though. kyou mentioned me that they were one of the people that pulled matt up off the ground (context: kyou is very strong and muscular so they were much more equipped than i). i asked kyou what it was like picking up matt, and they said "He was very sweaty and very heavy, lol." i talked more to them about him crowdsurfing and crushing someone, and they added "He did the same shit at the last concert I went to, and it went about as sloppily, lol."
                
                <br><br>
                but, this time matt is lifted up and successfully crowdsurfed back to the stage as someone shouts "we have to save machine girl". he gets on stage and stands for a second. then says "give me my fucking mic." HAHA.
                <br><br>
                The show keeps going. I feel it in my blood. I understand why Christians think this shit is demonic lol. You feel it in every cell in your body. It possesses you and you can't stop dancing. It's like you're not yourself. By this point, my inhibition was gone, and I just felt I couldn't even think. I was just at the concert listening to Machine Girl and screaming and dancing and having a good time. Before, I felt a bit self conscious, but it was kind of gone now. It felt like a religious experience as someone who's had many religious experiences against my will- I was euphoric. It was insane, and I wonder if I will ever that way again HAHA.
                <sub>sidenote: i just found out that feeling brought by the concert and religion is called collective effervescence.</sub>
                <br><br>               
                So the concert goes on. I don't feel like myself anymore. I'm being silly as fuck. There's a girl dancing with a backpack with spikes and i'm joking about it with a girl next to me. I find Kyou again and dance with them. I watch as Matt, who I remind you is ripped as fuck, CLIMBS THE FUCKING SUPPORT BEAM TO THE SECOND AT THE END OF THE SHOW AND STARTS PERFORMING FROM UP THERE. I tried really hard to get memorable Matt moments, but unfortunately, I do not have a clip of him climbing the beam, but I don't. What I do have is a clip of on the second floor.

                So, my takeaway, concerts are soo good for the soul, especially by a performer like Matt and crowd of Machine Girl fans. It was a really good time. I hope to see them again.
                <br><br>
                Also, bonus pictures. The Machine Girl merch guy/photographer, <a href="https://dominicsantos.com/">Dominic Santos</a>, took a pic of me because I am the coolest ever obviously. No it's just lolitas are interesting to look at. I wish there was a gaggle of us there, would've been fun as fuck.

                I also got merch baby. I don't own a record player, but I couldn't leave without a piece of Machine Girl merch, and the MG Ultra record art is cool as fuck. I also want to start collecting music for the inevitable downfall of spotify hehe.
