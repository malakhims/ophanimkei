        <h1>Chapter Eight - You Continue To Be A Pain</h1>
        <p>
            Cleo began to speak, still holding my hand, "That's Ameena and Fidele; they introduced themselves in the groupchat remember?"
            <br><br>
            I actually couldn't recall much of anything at all from the past few days. It was so weird, blurry. So much stuff had happened. I nodded though to avoid disappointing her.
            <br><br>
            "I'm Fidele by the way. You must be Cleo's new toy, and " the monotone voice came from the girl wearing an oversized dark green sweater, ripped baggy jeans, and black converse. Her unbrushed greasy brown hair reached to her hips and her eyes were a dull brown color. I couldn't tell if she was trying to be fashionable or if she had genuinely woke up, threw on clothes, and left her house.
            <br><br>
            Ameena was the other girl I assumed. Dark freckles dotted her tan face, and she had platinum blonde hair that fell in loose meticulous curls. Her outfit was simple; just a white t-shirt tucked into skinny jeans with a long pink jacket and combat boots. Her blue eyes seemed to be kind as well. I'd never seen her around the school before... If I had, I felt as though I would've remembered. Her dark skin made me think that she was of Indian decent? Or south Asian or perhaps even Arabian?
            <br><br>
            "I'm Ameena. Nice to meet you, Val," her voice was somewhat low and cool as if she spoke effortlessly. She seemed like the kind of girl who had thousands of followers on Instagram just because she was pretty. She might've been as pretty as Cleo, but it was definitely a different kind of beauty. I could describe Cleo as effortlessly beautiful while Ameena's meticulous curls, her blonde hair, and her carefully put together outfit clearly required planning.
            <br><br>
            Cleo smiled and finally released her grip on my hand. Her eyes sparkled as she addressed everyone, "Nice to see everyone here today. Valentina, Ameena, Fidele, Valerie, and me of course." Cleo set her backpack in a chair and pulled out a small pink laptop decorated with white cross shaped rhinestones. Her slender fingers lifted the screen open, and she entered her password.
            <br><br>
            "I was thinking we could plan matching outfits for the next few days to show that we're a unit. Something pastel and graceful of course..."
            <br><br>
            "That sounds expensive," Fidele mumbled. She was hiding her face behind her greasy locks and staring at the ground. "I don't have money for new clothes."
            <br><br>
            "Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Any other comments," Cleo's eyes narrowed on her screen as she waited.
            <br><br>
            I was a bit surprised when I heard Valentina speak, "I'm not comfortable wearing pastels." Cleo focused on Valentina and looked her up and down.
            <br><br>
            "Comfort.. Hm. Surprising."
            <br><br>
            Her hands tapped her laptop repetitively. "I didn't expect you to bring up comfort, Valentina. Something so small, such a tiny issue. We won't even wear matching outfits everyday~. Could you sacrifice a bit of comfort for me, please?"
            <br><br>
            I could feel something bad in the room. Confrontation wasn't my thing. Apparently, Valentina didn't want to be apart of it either. She just nodded and focused her gaze on the wall.
            <br><br>
            "What's your opinion Valerie?" Cleo's eyes brightened. "Pastels? Comfort? Does it matter if we all look like we're together?"
            <br><br>
            My face burned and I stared at my hands. There was only a few of us here. It didn't matter what I thought.. Did it? I wore hoodies, t-shirts, and sweaters mostly. So I understood where Valerie was coming from. I wasn't comfortable wearing pastels either, but I definitely wasn't going to tell her that. "I don't..." I tried to continue, "care..."
            <br><br>
            Cleo didn't smile at my response and faced her laptop. Coldly, she said, "Okay cool, matching outfits then. We can start. I'll bring the outfits to tomorrow's club meeting. That's it. Bye."
            <br><br>
            She stood up and walked off, not looking back. Her graceful steps didn't give off anger, but it was definitely full of tension. It was like she was ready to fight without actually fighting.
            <br><br>
            Valentina sighed. "I knew this would happen."
            <br><br>
            "I don't have money for anything new," Fidele chimed in. "I'm surprised she's going this overboard this time. I thought she learned by now."
            <br><br>
            What were they talking about...?
            <br><br>
            "Please don't talk mention that." Valentina looked at me briefly. "I might just not come to anymore meetings. I don't think she wants me here.."
            <br><br>
            That was unpleasant to hear. Valentina was so nice. I didn't want to be left alone with Cleo and these strangers. Cleo was great but so intimidating... And I didn't know Fidele and Ameena...
            <br><br>
            "Please don't leave," I muttered while looking at the ground. Valentina's eyes widened.
            <br><br>
            "I wasn't being serious," she reassured me. "Don't worry, okay."
            <br><br>
            Fidele groaned, "I'd kill myself if Valentina left. We need her."
            <br><br>
            Ameena nodded and closed her eyes. "I agree."
            <br><br>
            Valentina smiled a little. "I won't actually leave guys. Come on." She sat in the choir chair. "I'd never leave you alone with Ms. Perfect. I just think about it sometimes, you know?"
            <br><br>
            Was I missing something? "You don't like Cleo..." I whispered not meeting her eyes.
            <br><br>
            Valentina seemed to remember I was there. Her eyes lit up. "I have many feelings about her. I don't hate her, but if I had a choice, I would actively avoid her."
            <br><br>
            "A choice...?"
            <br><br>
            "It's a long story," Valentina replied. She had calmed down and seemed to have her happy outlook back. I liked Valentina's bright eyes, her happy resting face. It was a nice offset to the garbage life I lived.
            <br><br>
            "Why are you guys still here?" Cleo's voice surprised me. She'd come back. Her cold gaze had transitioned into something softer. Her face had reddened too... Had she cried? I almost felt bad.
            <br><br>
            "We were waiting for you of course," Valentina said. She stood up and rested her hand on Cleo's shoulder. "We'd never leave without your permission, after all. I'm sorry if I seemed rude.
            <br><br>
            Cleo smiled at Valentina. "I'm sorry for being rude earlier," she moved her hair behind her ear and looked away. "I was so excited for matching outfits... I was just surprised."
            <br><br>
            Valentina hugged Cleo and whispered something in her ear. Cleo laughed a little and they released each other.
            <br><br>
            "Let's go now really," Cleo said. "Remember, no meetings without the leader okay."
            <br><br>
            We exited the choir room and walked to the exit in a group. They chattered like the past few events hadn't happened. I fell behind quietly and just watched. Valentina and Cleo were talking. Ameena was riding on Fidele's back. I was still wondering what Valentina whispered in Cleo's ear. Was I being played? Maybe they liked seeing me confused.
            <br><br>
            What if Valentina and Cleo were together? That explained their dynamic...
            <br><br>
            "Valerie!"
            <br><br>
            My heat jumped. Lost in thought. Cleo was in front of me. I looked up at her. Her hair and her sparkling eyes were so captivating. "Since I can't walk with you today, I'd like a kiss goodbye."
            <br><br>
            Ameena was giggling and Valentina was looking away.
            <br><br>
            "This is our cue to leave," Fidele said. Ameena jumped off of Fidele's back and waved as well. They held each other's hands as they walked together.
            <br><br>
            Cleo's cupped my face in her hands and gave me a brief kiss. Just long enough for me to realize her lips tasted like strawberry chapstick.
            <br><br>
            She walked away, opposite direction from my place. I wondered why she walked with me the other day if she lived that way.
            <br><br>
            "Hey Valerie," Valentina said.
            <br><br> 
            I looked at her, my face red. I didn't realize getting kissed in public would make me feel so self conscious.
            <br><br>
            "I'll walk you home."
