        <h1>Preamble</h1>
        <p>
        I found this old story I made when I was 12-14 (I was on and off writing it from 2016-2018/2019 I believe), and I decided it'd be fun to archive.
        <br><br>
        I might archive more of these things if it appeals to me though most are too embarrassing for me to touch. I just thought this one was interesting as I think it is when I started to develop my sensibilities as a writer haha. If you've played my games, you'll probably see what I mean.
        <br><br>
        Just keep in mind I was 14! Haha. Don't expect Shakespearan stuff- especially since I don't even write in a Shakespearan way now haha. But also as an FYI, just because I acknowledge my flaws, it doesn't give you permission to make fun of 14 year old me. She was trying her best. 
        <br><br>
        I have no desire to cringe at my old writing or have friends point and laugh at things I used to write to 'laugh with me.' This is a boundary I'm establishing. Feel free to laugh amongst yourselves though, but for the pride of my younger self, I'd rather you not critique my middle school writing directly to my face. I carry my younger self with me. I respect her efforts. You understand don't you? Maybe you like to bully your younger self, but I try to treat her gently.
        <br><br>
        Thank you my loves. Let's have a good time going down memory lane together~
