        <h1>Chapter Ten - Little Secret</h1>
        <p>
            At school the next day, I kind of avoided everyone. Cleo texted me a few times but I didn't look at at a single message. I felt nauseated. My skin seemed corrupted; I wanted to hide. Every once in a while, I thought I'd feel someone staring at me. It was probably her. Was she worried about what happened yesterday too?
            <br><br>
            What if she was disappointed in me? What if I was just reacting badly? This was awful. Something I hadn't for seen.. Why did I meet Cleo in the first place? Her angelic presence was becoming more overwhelming each day.
            <br><br>
            In chemistry, Valentina sat next to me, but she didn't really say much. The teacher was giving us a long lecture today, and she dutifully took notes. Her crimson hair covered her face, but every once in a while, she'd glance at me. I found myself staring at her hands as she wrote. She wrote quickly and her letters were kind of old fashioned, like the writing you'd find in an old diary.
            <br><br>
            When the bell rang, she was still writing despite the fact that everyone else had put away her things. Her focus was honestly admirable. I wish I could actually listen in a lecture. When I heard the teachers speak, it was just noise. I could compare it to static really. All classes just became empty to me. Would I be able to graduate? Probably not. But I'd probably end my life before next year, so it didn't matter very much to me anymore.
            <br><br>
            I found myself staring at my hands as I waited for her. My brain wouldn't calm down and I kept replaying last night in my head. Cleo's hands on my back. Her hands were like spider limbs against my skin. Was I just a bug stuck in her silky web? A complicated giant web that was impossible to escape...
            <br><br>
            I felt a hand touch my shoulder, and I straightened up. My heart skipped a beat only to realize it was Valentina. She analyzed me with her oversoft gaze "Are you okay?" she asked.
            <br><br>
            The chemistry teacher walked out of the room leaving us alone, probably thinking I was about to have a breakdown or something. He wouldn't have been wrong.
            <br><br>
            I was going to say yes, but I felt bad lying to her. She was so kind, and her sincerity leaked through her words. Her gaze locked me into place.
            <br><br>
            I could feel my eyes began to burn, and I felt a tear being held up by the lower eyelashes before slipping down my cheek. A little laugh escaped my mouth. "I'm pretty scared actually."
            <br><br>
            She looked away and her face seemed to redden. Her reddening face contrasted with her violet lipstick. "Did Cleo do something?" she muttered.
            <br><br>
            "Nothing bad," I reassured her. "I was just surprised. "Dating is not what I expected. I don't think I like it."
            <br><br>
            Valentina sighed and picked up her backpack. "I need to tell you something." She refused to look me in the eyes as she prepared to leave the classroom.
            <br><br>
            I nodded, and she finally looked at me. Her eyes were watering when she spoke.
            <br><br>
            "My brother dated Cleo, and he killed himself."
