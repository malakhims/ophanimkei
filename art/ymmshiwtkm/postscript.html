        It's a bit interesting looking back. This story.. It makes me realize I knew myself at 14, but I kind of got lost due to various influences in my life that made me question what I knew about myself along with some other traumatic stuff. It's nice seeing this. I'm an adult now, but here I am writing about mentally ill angelic lesbians.

        I wish I had finished this story back then, but you probably saw in my author's notes, I wasn't sure if anyone was reading, and also I just had a lot of anxiety about being understood. I always worried by scatterbrainedness extended to my writing, but this was completely comprehensible. I was such a silly girl.
        <br><br>
        I hope you have a nice day!
