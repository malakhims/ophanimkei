         <a href="https://ophanimkei.itch.io/squid-girl-world-1" target="_blank"></a></iframe><br><b>Squid Girl EP 1</a><br></b>

         Squid Girl World is an 18+ visual novel series about abandoning all of your responsibilities and fleeing to a post apocalyptic mushroom planet. Deal with autism, be gay, and bathe in a lake all day.

         <br><br>

         I released EP0 a while ago. It's still canon, but I consider it more of a pilot. It's very rough. I feel much prouder of EP1 hence why it is linked here. See you when I make EP2!

        rehAIbilitation is a project <a href="https://zeddybear.neocities.org/">Zed</a> and I made for <a href="https://visualnovel.neocities.org/">VNCup</a> 2023! The theme was "any flavor of trans, queer, and gendery nature." I've always dreamed of collaborating with a friend.. It finally happened! And we made something beautiful I think!

        <br><br>
        What is it about you ask? A lolita travels to an isolated place in hopes of fixing herself, leaving behind something dear to her. She meets a peculiar nurse. 

        <br><br>

        It focuses on themes such as transness, mental illness, etc! It is intended for <b>mature audiences</b> due to content such as nudity, mental struggle, eating disordered behavior, and self harm.

            <br>
            I and dev friends hosted the Menhera VN Jam. It was a jam about writing stories about queer characters with mental health problems. There are lots of vns to read- NSFW and SFW so be aware. Choosing the winners was really hard.. I've never read that many visual novels in such a short period of time. It was fun, but also, I don't think I can ever do that again haha!

            I was interviewed by <a href="https://kingposs.com/">KingPoss</a>! I talked a lot about my projects, my time abroad, other things. It was really fun though quite anxiety inducing! The recording is up <a href="https://kingposs.com/radio">here</a>; feel free to check it out. Be kind to my dorky voice. 

            <br><br>
            Also, you should totally reach out and be interviewed by KingPoss if you're interested! It's really fun! And check out his other broadcasts.
